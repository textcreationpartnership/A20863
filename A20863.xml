            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10478:8"/>
of his ſpeech was his own calamity: for the malignity of fortune together with his diſaſters had made him clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Look on me neighbour (ſaid the oak) and thou ſhalt behold the mirror of misfortune. I hardly retain the moiety of my ſelf, I am ſo ſhaken and miſerably torn in pieces: thus have the boiſtrous winds handled me. But what (I pray thee) ſhall I more admire? thy ſafety, or mine own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? there is no compariſon between thy ſtrength and mine. The eie of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man may witneſſe, that I am a thouſand times ſtronger then a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, yea then a thouſand reeds; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding being aſſaulted by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſtormy winds, I ſeem to have no ſtrength at all; but am ſhaken, torn, broken, and puld up by the roots. In the mean time thou findeſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to delude theſe impetuous winds, fightſt with a hollow &amp; empty trunck, ever victorious, ſtill triumphant; whileſt we (vaſt giants) are ſoon van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. How comes this to paſſe? The reed that had learned to be ſilent and reſerved, forbearing a long while to interrupt the oake, at laſt replied in this manner: There is no reaſon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10478:8"/>
(good neighbour ſaid ſhe) why you ſhould wonder at this: your ſtrength is the ſole cauſe of your deſtruction; if that were leſſe, you (ſafe and ſound) would flouriſh. You are (by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) too confident in your forces: you conteſt and ſtrive with the winds, and thereby are utterly ruinated; you have a potent enemy that will give way to none, ſuch an one as is anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his adverſaries forces, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more powerfull when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters with the ſtrongeſt: the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulty he finds in the aſſault, the more certain he is of victory. Hence commeth it to paſſe that the higheſt and thickeſt oaks are ſooneſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the winds, that deride and laugh at the folly of weak reſiſtance. I, not being ignorant of my own frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, an hundred times a day humbly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and bow down even to the earth.

                  <p>Tis even ſo with man; ſtrength is not ſecure, where counſell and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are wanting. The wind of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity

From the ſtudy of literature, ſome go to be Clerks, Sextons, yea and Carriers; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be maltſters, ſurveiors of land, or husbandmen: it matters not what thou learneſt, but what benefit thou makeſt by learning: as the condition of ſcholers is different, ſo is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; ſome want wit, others money, ſome induſtry: and ſo neither they, nor theſe, nor the other attain to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>The like happens in the School of Patience, or School of Chriſt, where the profit that ſtudents reap, is corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to their ardent deſire, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10478:9"/>

                  <p>But what book need we in this School, what volumes muſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve? It was a laudable cuſtome in ancient times to preſent a ſchedule to their gueſts, or ſend it home to their houſes, where all the diſhes to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in at the feaſt were ſpecified. By this means every man was advertiſed before hand, ſo many courſes you ſhall have, theſe and theſe diſhes, ſo many in number, and in ſuch and ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Wherefore if none of the firſt courſe be pleaſing to your palate, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and keep your ſtomack for the ſecond, or the third. So fitting was it thought that the gueſts ſhould know before hand what the houſe keeper intended to ſet before them.</p>
                  <p>It will be no leſſe expedient in the Schol of Patience, to know with what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10478:10"/>
calamities Almighty God is wont to viſit and afflict mortals. The firſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Scholer, is, to inform himſelf of the books wherein he muſt ſtudy. Job ſolicitous in this point, ſaid; Let himſelf who judgeth, write a book, that I may bear it on my ſhoulders.

                     <p>Rods, ſignifie dolours and diſeaſes, which are almoſt innumerable, and every one more or leſſe, participates of the bitternes of death. Theſe rods are preparatives, to diſpoſe us for death: the high way to death, is by diſeaſes. A diſeaſe often times hath prolonged life, and the readieſt way to recover men, was to beleeve they could not live. Vertue finds a place even in the bed of the ſick man.</p>

After this maner men are commonly exerciſed by poverty.</p>
                     <p>A garland of ſtraw, is the ſymbole of deriſion, contempt, and contumely; ſcarcely ſhall you ſee the ſcholers of this ſchool ſo ſenſible of any diſgrace, as of this garland, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding amongſt them is ordinary.

                     <p>Under theſe ſowr kinds of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is contained for the moſt part, whatſoever we ſuffer. For it is either

                     <p>Chains and cords, are peculiar mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and proper to each mans eſtate, every man is obliged, ſome more, ſome leſſe, according to his condition of life. Wedlock is a ſtrong tie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a chain of iron, or rather of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant, which none but death can break. Often times married couples find neither hunger, nor thirſt, nor want of health, but only want of peace and unity: the one objecting to the other; I can neither live with thee,

                     <p>A Thouſand reaſons may be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, why God doth not vouchſafe to give his ſervants a Paradiſe on earth; but rather ſends them thither from the croſſe. Heer I appeal to the ordinary cuſtome of men: If a man conceives no hatred againſt a lewd houſe for being beaten there, or tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

down a pair of ſtairs, much leſſe will he deteſt that houſe, if he be kindly entertained: So if we ſhould be well intreated in this world, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any would ſeek after the joyes of heaven. Not one man amongſt a thouſand, but would ſay, I am well contented with thoſe which I already have, why ſhould I ſeek after uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties? Many men beſotted with their pleaſures and riches, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect heaven, and, like brutiſh Oxen, lye down in the paſture they go in. Therefore it was requiſite, that all things heer ſhould be mingled with gall, leſt the hony of this world ſhould be preferred before the ſweetneſſe of heaven. Why, I pray you, was Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt ſo cruell and malicious towards the Hebrews? for their governours (as we read) were moſt tyrannicall, their taskes doubled, their ſcourges and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions inſufferable; and beſides, all their male children were threatned to be killed: what was Gods deſigne herein? Nothing elſe but to beget in his people an extream hatred and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Aegypt; and conſequently, of Idolatry in generall. To this end were the exhortations of Moſes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10478:20"/>
them to deſire the land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. To this end was Pharaoh ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to tyrannize, that the Hebrewes conceiving hatred againſt ſo cruell a Lord, might ſeek another more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able countrey.</p>

A traveller (eſpecially ſuch an one as is eaſily diſpoſed to loyter) is ſoon perſwaded to ſtay and ſolace himſelf under ſhady trees, and in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant medows; ſeeks new and new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, one while ſitting down in this place, and another while in that, till he hath trifled, and idly ſpent the whole day. Therefore Saint Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſaith, that our Lord maketh in this world the way which leads to heaven rough and ſharp to his elect, leſt any of them, entertained with eaſe and delights of this life, as with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant way, ſhould rather deſire to hold

                     <p>And as it doth much inkindle the love of God to have but once taſted how ſweet our Lord is: even ſo, to have ſomewhat felt the bitterneſſe of tranſitory things, doth not a little thruſt us forward to the hatred of them.

Hence comes it, that God is in a manner forced to give us bitter potions, leſt we rather covet to drink vinegar and wormwood, then celeſtiall nectar, and prefer earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heaven.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10478:21"/>
of himſelfe, So immenſe is the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God, that no man may be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med worthy thereof, before he be throughly exerciſed with ſundry cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, like a ſtout and couragious Champion, who cannot challenge the prize before he hath ſought the combat. To good purpoſe was that which Nicetas Choniates ſaid; He is onely miſerable, who in affliction is too much contriſtated; and thereby rendreth himſelfe unworthy of God.</p>
                     <p>Iſaac being now almoſt blinde with age, ſought by touching to finde out his ſon: Come hither (ſaid he) my ſon, that I may feel thee, and may prove whether thou beeſt my ſon Eſau or no. In like manner God dealeth with us: I muſt touch thee, my childe, (ſaith he) my hands are hot indeed, they burn, but if thou be my childe, thou wilt ſuffer me to touch thee: he that refuſeth to be touched by me, is none of mine, and is unworthy of me. I ſuffered my only Son to be crucified, and I found him worthy of me: Even in the ſame ſort I dealt with his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-mother, transfixed her heart with a ſword of griefe, which for many years together I pulled not out, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10478:22"/>
found her worthy of me: nor have I otherwiſe treated my deareſt friends, and I found them worthy of me. And wouldſt thou be ſingular, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from the number of the afflicted? If thou eſcape without chaſtiſement, thou art likely to have no ſhare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt my children. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do I exerciſe and try my children, and by chaſtiſing honour them. More enriched and honoured was Joſeph in exile, then in his fathers houſe. Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel amongſt captives was comforted with heavenly miracles.

I am bound and burned, but for the hope of heavenly joyes endure it couragiouſly: It is that I deſire, I would rather have fire burn, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome me: I had rather my God ſhould call me in this world to wage war, then to live in delights. I know well, the Oxe deſigned to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is left at his own liberty in the pleaſant paſtures, while another preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the heavie yoke, is ſuffered to live.

but give me the nobleſt metals, Gold or Silver, and I hurt them not, they are welcome to my boſome, them I purifie and refine: for they are worthy of me. And hath the fire ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence amongſt other things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it imbraceth nothing but that which is moſt worthy of it? what ſhall we then think of God? Malachias ſtruck with admiration, ſaith: Who ſhall be able to think of the day of his advent? and who ſhall ſtand to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>God proceeds after this manner for three ends: for whom he affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell is it, if God daily puniſh and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us? we daily offend him: for the juſt man falls ſeven times a day, God dealeth herein, as doth a carefull and induſtrious man; who, that he may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10478:23"/>
not come in debt, payes all with ready money: ſo God mercifully expiateth daily our offences with daily miſeries. And this is a great favour: for whilſt we are judged, we are corrected by our Lord, that we may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with this world. King David ſaid well: Before I was humbled, I ſinned. Sin and puniſhment are never f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The other end for which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts us, is to teach and correct us. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In ſtead of watching, he falls a ſleep; then forſakes his ſtanding and flies, hurls away his weapons and denies his Captain at the voyce of a ſilly maid. But by this means S.

                     <p>Juſtus Lipſius, the luſtre of this our age, and (as it was ſaid of Pliny) the matchleſſe Prince of learning, though he were moſt addicted to the Muſes, yet he far preferred piety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: many years together he weekly made his confeſſion. He had a very neat Library, furniſhed with choyce bookes for all whatſoever that ſerved for rare and polite literature, which he could procure for love or money, out of all parts of the world, he had ſtored up there. In a word, it was a treaſure beyond all Maggazines of gold, gathered together in one houſe. There was nothing upon earth that Lipſius loved more ardently then this learned delight: a man would have ſaid his heart had been wholly enſhrined in this Library. But (O my God) O moſt diſaſterous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance! that which with ſo great care and diligence he had gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſo many years, all that with a ſudden fire, was in one moment bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10478:25"/>
to aſhes. Out alas! I verily think Lipſius had rather have loſt himſelfe, then this which came ſo neer him. But this is Gods uſuall cuſtome, theſe are the rewards wherewith he recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vertue in this world, and ſhould be taken for great favours. Thus God dealeth with his beſt friends, either depriving them of that which they moſt dearly affect, or not granting what they moſt earneſtly requeſt. Sometimes you ſhall have a man, who as if he would perſwade God, not to take away his delights, will petition him in this manner: O my Lord, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me at thy pleaſure, ſo thou grant me this, or take not away that which I ſo infinitely love. God hears not theſe prayers; he takes away that which is moſt dear, and gives not that which is moſt deſired, and ſo even transfixeth the heart of man: yet this is a favour, and one of Gods rewards. After this ſort did the Angell comfort Tobias, ſaying: Becauſe thou wert acceptable to God, it was needfull that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould prove thee. As if he had ſaid, Whereſoever yertue is, there muſt be affliction (the reward of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.) Every one that is moſt dear to God is chaſtiſed.</p>

                     <p>But now and then God chaſtiſeth where he neither intendeth to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſin, reform errours, nor exerciſe vertue, but onely to manifeſt his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which our Saviour plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that blind man in the Goſpell: This man (ſaith he) hath not ſinned, nor his parents, but onely that the workes of God may be manifeſted in him. Some will ſay, with what equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can this be done? may I lawfully ſtrip another to cloath my ſelfe? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that there are two kinds of law or juſtice; the one ſtrict, ſevere, and extream, and as Divines call it, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignum:</hi> the other mitigated or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as when any thing is decreed with lenity and mercie. Wherefore admit all men were innocent Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remies, Daniels, Baptiſts, yet might God, out of the rigour of his juſtice, puniſh them, in regard of the innate originall ſin, which (being the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

preſuppoſing originall ſin, God may juſtly, and yet punctually obſerving the Law, puniſh <hi>(de condigno)</hi> even the moſt innocent, with what afflictions ſoever, ſo they be not eternall. Hence it is, that many infants are puniſhed by death and diſeaſes. How much more juſtly may we then be puniſhed, who to originall adde many actuall ſins? Moreover, if any one complaine, that God takes from him that which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily he uſeth to beſtow on others, as food, health, riches, and the like, God may juſtly anſwer, I ow thee nothing, what I have hitherto given, take, as from the hand of my free bounty and goodnes, all my gifts are <hi>gratis.</hi> Now I withdraw them, that thou maiſt know they came from me, and that freely without any obligation of my part. Hitherto I have dealt liberally with thee, if it be my pleaſure not to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it, what law haſt thou againſt me? may not I do what pleaſes me? Friend, I do thee no injury: take that which is thine, and get thee gone.

It is the Princes pleaſure to give this man a horſe, to that a chain of gold, to one a Captains place, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing. But ſuppoſe (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this) that things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſuſtain life be due unto us, were it an injury for God, by vertue onely of ſupreme honour and title of maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, to abridge us of them? what cauſe have we to complain? we are ſubjects, and conſequently bound to obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.

                     <p>We well know that life is dearer then either health, riches or honour: All which a man hath he will give for his life.

If then the governour of a Monaſtery doth well &amp; orderly in exerciſing even his innocent ſubjects with contumelies, what wrong doth God, the governor of the worlds moſt ample monaſtery, bounded, as it were, with the walls of the heavens, and vaſt Ocean? what wrong, I ſay, doth this omnipotent Father in exerciſing his children with hunger, diſeaſes, poverty, and other injuries?

                     <p>This then may be the Oracle of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; That Vertue without an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary decayes and pines away: without a croſſe Patience falls aſleep.

But obſerve heer what the maſter doth ſometimes in the School: He ſees two of his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſleeping in their ſeverall places, and forthwith calls alowd to one of their fellows, ſaying, Pinch that Boy, and awake him; mean while lets the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſleep, as if he ſaw him not. And why commands he not both to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened? The reaſon is, becauſe the one is docible &amp; capable of learning, and ſhortly after ſhal be commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat his leſſon, being of a ſharp wit, &amp; ready tongue, and therfore wel belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his maſter. The other Endymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the dunce &amp; drone of the ſchool, never better, or more at quiet then when hee ſleeps.

his moſt forward and apteſt ſcholars, ſcourgeth every child whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives into his favour.</p>

                     <head>Sect. III.</head>
                     <p>THE third reaſon is to increaſe their faith. He that learns, ought to believe. We beleeve there is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven prepared for the bleſſed, and a hell for the damned; but, I beſeech you, what lively faith or aſſurance have we of either? No eye could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver penetrate to hell, nor do any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from heaven to declare how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters go there. This cogitation affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth many: for ſome thinking not rightly with themſelves, have ſaid: There was never any known to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from hell. Nevertheleſſe, we muſt beleeve that there are both theſe places, except we conclude that God is unjuſt: for if he who hath cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted to puniſh the wicked, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the good, payes neither in this world, certainly in the world to come he will not fail, both to puniſh the one, and liberally to reward the other. But moſt evident it is, that many heer want the reward of their vertue, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10478:35"/>
in ſtead thereof are oppreſſed with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury, afflicted with diſeaſes, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with whole troops of miſeries. Neither have the wicked their pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this life; for they ſaile with a proſperous and favourable gale of wind: whereas they deſerve to be toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the moſt tempeſtuous waves that may be. Well then, may the hope of the vertuous daily increaſe, and the bad have moſt juſt cauſe to fear, that he whom they ſo much hate, ſhall be their judge at laſt. Certainly there are none, how good or bad ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but ſhall have their hire. Seeing therefore none are ſo w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cked, but that ſometimes (even forgetting their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe) they do or ſay well: for which, how little ſoever it be, they ſhall receive a temporall reward; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ſhall have their eternall puniſhment at length, though deferred for a time. The higheſt is a patient debtor. Wherefore by this means our faith may be ſtrengthened, and by theſe temporall puniſhments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, gather an aſſured beliefe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon is to illuminate the underſtanding. The maſter in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10478:35"/>
School ought principally to labour, that children by little and little may learn to grow wiſe, caſt off their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhneſſe, and come to know their own ignorance. This is that which God himſelfe endeavoureth in the School of Patience: That vexation may give underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>In very deed we never ſufficiently apprehend how miſerable and fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>il we are, till our own miſeries teach us. Moreover, we are too much beſotted with ſelfe-love, and eaſily thereby perſwaded, that we are unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure many things: And yet the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of experience it ſelfe ſetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, and teacheth us, whether we will or no, how much we can (if our will be not wanting) endure for Chriſts ſake. Many ſick perſons ſuffer that, which when they were well, they thought they could never have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: yea, and by ſuffering this, learn how poor &amp; ſlender our patience is in time of health. It is an eaſie matter to be patient when we have nothing to trouble us. King David blaming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſaid: In my proſperity I ſaid, I will not be moved for ever. Thou haſt turned away thy face from me,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10478:36"/>
and I was troubled. Peter (if he had not fallen ſo miſerably) would never have beleeved himſelfe to be ſo weak and pufillanimous. In the place of the laſt Supper he boaſting ſaid: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I were to dye with thee, yet would I not deny thee, though all ſhould be ſcandalized, yet would not I. But ſhortly after he ſaw his own weakneſſe. For this cauſe the wiſe man adviſeth: My ſon, in thy life time try thy ſoule, and if it be wicked, give it no power. What knowledge hath he of himſelfe, that is not temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? To know himſelfe, he muſt try himſelfe. No man knowes what thou art able to do, no not thy ſelfe, unleſſe ſome difficulty give thee oceaſion thereof. How far the alarm will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake a mans courage, is then known, when the alarm is given. The ſent of pepper is not ſmelt till it bee pounded. It is never known how well the Lute or Harp are tuned, till they be touched.

patience by ſuffering moſt grievous diſeaſes: Stephen by ſtretching forth his putrified limbs to the Chyrurgian to be cut off, while he, the patient, not to loſe time, wove palm branches with his hands; and with ſo undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a courage and countenance, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe to be cut, as if it had not been his arm, but anothers body. And when others, even with looking on, were ſenſible of his pain, he ſaid unto them: O my children! what ſoever God doth, is to a good end: Let us combat, let us ſuffer, whilſt we are as Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within the liſts.

but feeles ſometimes gnawing, aking, or griping paines. Eyther their head, eyes, teeth, armes, legges, or ſtomacke akes. And what wonder? We are even a ſeminary of diſeaſes, &amp; do we thinke it ſtrange to bee ſick? Diſeaſes creepe into every age and ſtate of life. Wee are no ſooner borne but we beginne to be ſicke: and therefore may believe Saint Auguſtine, for who is there, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug. in Pſa.</hi> 102. <hi>ante med mihi pag.</hi> 473.</note> ſaith he, that is not ſicke in this life? who is there that lingreth not in one languour or other? our birth in this mortall body is no other then a prelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium or entrance to infirmities. Why then are wee affraid at the approach of diſeaſes?</p>
                     <p>This life is a perpetuall diſeaſe. But <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Idem Serm.</hi> 74.</note> yet beleeve me, there is a place for vertue in ſickneſſe: which by the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Senec. Epiſt.</hi> 76.</note> of Saint Ambroſe is verified: the infirmity of the body is the ſobriety of the minde. Infirmity is the forge of vertue; and, as Hierom ſaith, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have the ſtomack ſick then the minde. There have been ſome, but very few, who have lived to fourſcore years of age in perfect health: yet this old houſe began to decay, and at laſt was diſſolved, and utterly ruinated.</p>

Thus much let us be aſſured of, that for the moſt part, none behave themſelves better in ſickneſſe, then they who in time of health have often learned the Art of ſuffering amongſt ſick perſons. Here let every man queſtion himſelfe in this ſort: If thou wert in this ſtate, how wouldſt thou demean thy ſelfe? how mildly and pleaſingly wouldſt thou ſpeake? how patiently wouldſt thou ſuffer thy pains?</p>
                     <p>To ſeek for health from witches, or ſorcerers, is the property of a man deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and wretchedly in love with his life. Is there not a God in Iſrael, that you go to ſeek counſell of Beelzebub the God of Accaron? Let our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe draw us to God, not to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell the enemy of God.</p>
                     <p>The Hebrews when they were freed from diſeaſes and ſlaughters, forgat their God: but no ſooner were their infirmities multiplied, but they made haſte to return unto him. Sometimes the neck, foot, or arme is cauterized to cure the head: So God burns and cauterizes the body with diſeaſes, to heal the ſoul. A painfull diſeaſe makes a ſober ſoul, ſaith the wiſe man. And
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10478:42"/>
to ſay truth, it is better to be ſcorched with a burning feaver, then with the flames of ſin.</p>

                     <p>There was a certain religious man, (as teſtifieth Ruffinus Aquileienſis) who earneſtly requeſted an holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choret named John, to cure him of a tertian.

                     <p>Sure if wee would conſider of this matter as we ought, ſhould finde ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be ſo great a benefit, ſent from God, that a hundred yeares ſervice were too little to deſerve it. In ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we are invited to make our peace with God, whom perhaps before we oppoſed and grievouſly exaſperated. Bleſſed Saint Gregory ſaith that ſicke perſons are to be admoniſhed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much good they may reape by corporall afflictions, which both expiate the ſinnes formerly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reſtraine them from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the like afterwards.

perhaps change our note, were our health exchang'd for their ſickneſſe.

                     <p>PAins and griefes are arrowes pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing deeper then any two-edged ſword. King David being very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of theſe arrowes, ſaith: Thy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes are ſharp; cares, irkſomneſſe, griefe, feare, ſickneſſe, wound the ſoule like arrowes. It is in a manner the greateſt griefe of all to have a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mind. For as mentall delights far exceed all corporall; ſo the griefe and anguiſh of the mind far ſurpaſſes all other dolours.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt the Redeemer of the world, on mount Olivet and mount Calvary, complained not of ſtripes and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor of the ſharp pricking thornes and nails, but upon the croſſe cried out of his grieved mind, that he was forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his father.</p>
                     <p>The ſorrow and heavineſſe of Chriſt was inexplicable, which cauſed thoſe lamentable voices: My ſoule is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10478:46"/>
heavie even to death. And, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? The wounds of the mind exced all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall acerbities: And therefore the wiſe man ſaid, Griefe of heart is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall wound.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes Almighty God brings his ſervants into ſuch ſtraits, that all things ſeem to oppoſe them; and, which is the greateſt miſery, they think that God himſelfe is highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with them. Nevertheleſſe, they are not deſtitute of hope, but again and again cry, O my Lord God! in the day I have cried, and in the night before thee: becauſe my ſoul is filled with evill things, and my life hath drawn near to hell. I am poore, and in labours from my youth: Or (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to others) I am afflicted, and like to one giving up the ghoſt: from my youth I have born thy terrours, and have trembled.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture tells us, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes paſſing out of Egypt, came into Mara, and could not drink the waters of Mara, becauſe they were bitter, &amp;c. There he gave them precepts and judgements, and there he tried them. Here one will ſay, I beſeech thee,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10478:46"/>
Lord, was there not a more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place for the enacting of thy Lawes? Did the worſt ſeem unto thee the fitteſt? heer the very water it ſelfe increaſed their thirſt.</p>
                     <p>But (Reaſon) what meaneſt thou here to expoſtulate? There God eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Lawes and Precepts, and there he tempted and tried them. For this affaire the moſt incommodious place was moſt fitting for them. In the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt fertill countries, amidſt delicacies, the Law of God, for the moſt part, is contemned. Felicity is but ſtepmother to all vertues. They who are oppreſſed with adverſities, and fearfull of loſing their eſtates, learn ſooner to fear God, then they who by felicity are invited to laſciviouſneſſe. For the moſt part God is neereſt unto us in adverſity. Therefore Nahum the Prophet ſaid: Our Lord was in the tempeſt, in the whirlwind of his way.

Jonathan and David (that noble paire of friends) thus agreed betweene themſelves. I (ſaid Jonathan) will ſhoote three arrowes, and will ſhoote as it were practiſing at a marke. I will likewiſe ſend a boy ſaying unto him, goe bring me my arrowes, if I ſay to the boy looke, the arrowes are on this ſide thee, take them up, come to me, for then all is in peace, and nothing amiſſe. God every day and moment ſhootes and ſends forth his arrowes out of his bow, and powreth forth on men all kinds of maladies.

                     <p>BUrning Tapers are the emblemes of poverty. Poverty (if it lighteth upon a man that knows how to make good uſe of it) is a moſt efficacious meanes to attain to vertue. God in the School of Patience, divers wayes makes uſe of this inſtrument. There are ſome brought to ſuch extream po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, that they have not ſo much as bread to ſatisfie their hunger, nor are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10478:50"/>
they able with their hand-labour to get their livings: theſe are worthy of compaſſion. Of ſuch may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that ſaying of Diogenes: Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is no ordinary ſickneſſe. There are others who ſuffer in private a world of miſery (ſhame-fac'd beggers I mean) who rather chuſe to ſtarve then beg: certainly theſe deſerve no leſſe commiſeration then the former. There are others poore and needy, but withall idle and lazie, ſuch as might eaſily free themſelves from poverty, if they would firſt ſhake off ſloath: they will take no pains, and ſo fall into the ſnare of beggery. They had rather ſtarve then not be idle. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers very laborious, but croſt by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall caſualties, are notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſubject to poverty. Some there are who ſeem to be very rich, and yet ſo far in debt, that they have almoſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ls. To theſe we may well ſay He is rich that is not in debt. And finally, ſome there are who ſeem poore onely to themſelves whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their diſeaſe proceeds not ſo much from poverty as covetouſneſſe: they want not victuals, but they deſire to have them in a more pompous and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10478:50"/>
magnificent manner. They are not content to be clothed and fed, but they will have dainty and coſtly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands: theſe kinde of people you ſhall heare often complaining, how many things do I ſtand in need of? And ſurely theſe ungratefull wretches, who are not content with their eſtates, are not onely very poore, but even in ſome ſort moſt miſerable. Next to theſe are they of whom Saint Chryſoſtome ſpeakes: Even Kings themſelves have <note place="margin">

                     <p>Abſolon having once or twice Tent his ſervants to invite Joab, that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Captain, to come unto him, when he ſaw he came not, what, think you, did this royall young man? The books of Kings record? And when he had ſent the ſecond time, and he would not come unto him, he ſaid to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: Know yee Joabs field that lies neer to mine, containing his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley harveſt? go therefore and burn it with fire. After this manner God humbleth many men, and with flames of poverty even forceth them to better courſes. Whom he knoweth to be proud, or elſe foreſeeth (except he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them) they will become contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious and inſolent.</p>
                     <p>Let this therefore be the Leſſon which we ought to learn in the School of Patience, leſt poverty (a thing in it ſelfe not evill) by the abuſe become an evill unſupportable. The wiſe man

                     <p>The Scholars in the School of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience muſt otherwiſe behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they are burned with the fire of poverty.

What are we afraid of? Why delay we? Why ſeek we to avoid this furnace of poverty? The fire is terrible, but our Lord is with us in tribulation: If God be with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10478:52"/>
us, who can ſtand againſt us? Let us therefore, that we may take no harm by poverty, ſeriouſly revolve this in our minde, that all poverty, whatſoever it be, is laid upon us by God for our greater good, that we may be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refined from our droſſe.</p>
                     <p>Even as a tender and loving mother when ſhe beholds her childe playing abroad in the yard, fiercely aſſaulted by Turkey-cockes and hens (becauſe he is in a red coate) with wings rais'd, traine diſplayed, and briſtling creſtes; preſently ſteps to him and takes him from thoſe furious fowles, and (though the childe cry and mourne to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe diſrob'd) ſhe pulls off his ſcarlet wherewith Turkies naturally become ſo fierce, and all this ſhe doth for the good of her little one, not moved at all with his fond and childiſh teares: let him weepe and ſpare not, ſo he may eſcape this imminent danger. So God oftentimes uncloathes us, takes away our goodes, oppreſſeth us with poverty, but all for our good, for by this means we are delivered from many dangers, from the aſſaults of the Divell, and ſnares of manifold ſinnes: but we like children cry and lament, wrangle and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10478:52"/>
complaine that we are deprived of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and brought to utter begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Oh you fooliſh babes! why weepe you, why complaine you? all this is done for your good. God would not have bereaved you of temporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but that he foreſaw they would become very prejudiciall to you; he would not have reduced you to this poore eſtate, but that he perceiv'd from all eternity you ſhould not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe attaine to the kingdome of heaven.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, commit theſe anxious cares to this moſt loving father, who infinitely exceeds in providence and compaſſion, the moſt tender mother.

                     <p>Oh you that are poore! whoſoever you be, what thinke you of ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who ſees his little ſonne with bread in his hand, and a maſtiffe lying in waite, and ready to bit him by the fingers? were it not a point of wiſdom in him, and a wary foreſight of future miſchiefe, rather then a depriving the childe of victualls, to ſnateh the bread out of his hand? So God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deprives us of food and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall felicities, not to impoveriſh or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, but to reclaime us from ſinne. Is not vertue for the moſt part baniſhed, &amp; all kinde of vices imbrac'd in their kingdome, where men fare daintily, ſleepe largely, and ſpend the day idly.</p>
                     <p>Happy therefore are the poore, who
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10478:54"/>
willingly embracing poverty, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it as a ſpeciall friend to vertue. To this end was that generous ſpeech of Saint Paul uttered: The things which were to me a gaine, the ſame I deem'd for Chriſt a detriment.</p>
                     <p>No man is worthy of God, but he that knowes how to contemne riches, and he is truely rich who agreeth well with poverty. To this purpoſe Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſaid: Poverty is a vertue which is learn'd of it ſelfe. The matter is plaine: ſhould not riches be taken from us we ſhould be undone and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by them. And who is he that can ſo warily touch theſe thornes, and not wound his owne conſcience? po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty alone is not wounded by this thorny brake. He abhorres not pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who aſpires to bleſſed immortality. For as truely ſaith Saint Gregory: Whoſoever he be that fixeth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire upon eternity, can neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred with poverty, nor ſhaken with adverſity.</p>

                     <p>But this is an apparant ſigne of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pride, which liketh nothing worſe then to be blamed or ſhamed by bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: whereupon ſome men, ſingular as well for learning as contempt of themſelves, (when their ruin was to read at dinner or ſupper) purpoſely pronounced ſome words amiſſe, that they might be forced to bluſh at their owne diſſembled ignorance.</p>
                     <p>When Martin Delrio (a man of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient houſe; and, by the many notable books he wrote famous for his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) had divers years profeſſed divinity at Liege, he was by command ſent to Tornay, where according to the rules of his Order, he might retire himſelf from publick reading and noiſe of the world, and quietly ſpend ſome time in holy meditations. Heer he laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide both Philoſophy and Divinity, underwent, yea even ambitiouſly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10478:57"/>
ſought after all the moſt abject offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongſt religious novices. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a poore thred bare cloake he attended the Cater to the market, and carried to the Colledge the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he bought, thorow the ſtreets in view of all the people, taking upon him the office of a poore Porter. This man neither feared, nor refuſed the garland of ſtraw; nay he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe honoured by wearing it. This above all the reſt much aſtoniſhed the religious of his order, to ſee a man ſo grave and learned, after he had ſpent ſo many years in the ſocity of Jeſus, been reader a long time in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Divinity, and a preacher highly eſteemed; after all this, I ſay, his ſight failing him, and almoſt blind with age, ſo diligently and willingly (whilſt others ſate at table) to ſtand or incommodiouſly ſit at the uſuall deske, reading, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, ſome pious book, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the tones and accents according to the direction of others. Behold how Delrio with a prompt and ready will embraced a garland of ſtraw. Nothing ſeemed to him ſo ignominious and ſhamefull in his latter yeares, as the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10478:58"/>
feare of ſhame and ignominy.</p>
                     <p>The like did Lanfranke, a man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly endued with all manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature: He on a time was appointed reader, and being by his unlearned Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour commanded to repeat what he had read, and to pronounce it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rules of Grammar, readily obeyed. Queſtionleſſe he reputed this ſtraw garland a ſpeciall ornament: This good man was not aſhamed, for Chriſts ſake, to be put to ſhame. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius Gonzaga did the like, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in his life.</p>
                     <p>When the minde is once throughly ſteel'd with vertue, it becomes impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, no deriſions nor contempts can ever wound it. Can a man, think you, truly reſign'd to the will of God, be at any time moved with ignominy, who hath once fully rejected the opinion of the world, and placed all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in Chriſt his Saviour? An ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious death is beyond all ignominy: yet this ſo many thouſand holy Martyrs have embraced with as cheerfull a countenance as other when they are adorned with purple and diadems. Chriſt himſelfe, King of Martyrs, to this end, ſuffered a moſt ignominious
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10478:58"/>
death, to teach his ſervants to ſuffer, and not to put affronts and diſgraces upon others. No man is more pleaſed with contempt, then he who hath firſt learned to contemne himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>A true deſpiſer of himſelfe is as content with contumelies, as if they were miters, and then moſt of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth and applauds his happineſſe, when he is moſt derided. For true glory indeed is to ſuffer with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie for Chriſts ſake, as well the greateſt as the leaſt reproach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely. The true diſciples of Chriſt are crowned firſt with thornes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with gold and pretious gems.</p>
                     <p>King David purſuing the Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites, found in the field an Egyptian even ſick to death, and ſtrictly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him about his countrey, houſe and kindred; who returned this anſwer: I am an Egyptian young man, ſervant to one that is an Amalekite, and my maſter hath left me behinde, becauſe I fell ſicke three dayes ſince. David commanded this man to accompany him after he had ſworn him. S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory having conſidered theſe paſſages, <note place="margin">Greg. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang.</note> ſaid, God chuſeth thoſe whom the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10478:59"/>
world deſpiſeth; becauſe for the moſt, part, by being deſpiſed, a man comes to know himſelf. The garland of ſtraw is an ignominy prejudiciall to none but ſuch as are impatient.</p>
                     <p>Let us go therefore (as Saint Paul encourageth us) let us go out of the Camp to meet Chriſt Jeſus, carrying upon us his diſgrace. Saint Paul is our leader to that bloudy pavilion of Chriſt crucified; he exhorts us to follow him through glory and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, through infamy and good fame, as ſeducers, yet ſpeakers of the truth.

                     <p>All that can be ſaid of theſe kindes of miſeries and moleſtations, is, that they are burdenſome, but wholſome, if they be willingly embraced. For as Saint Auguſtine ſaith, God regards <note place="margin">

                     <p>Abigail the wiſeſt amongſt the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of her time, beſides the preſent of all kindes of viands, to appeaſe King Davids wrath, made likewiſe her addieſſe by a notable oration, ſaying, The ſoul of my Lord ſhall be kept as ſafe as if it were in the poſie of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, with thy Lord God: but the ſoule of thy enemies ſhall be wheeled about, as it were in the force and circle of a ſling. Heer this wiſe Lady, by an excellent compariſon, ſhewed the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the lives of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and juſt, eſpecially in ſuffering ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities. Good and vertuous men are
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10478:60"/>
like freſh flowers, which the Gardiner having newly gathered, leſt they ſhould be ſcattered and wither, ties them together in a noſegay, with ſo ſtrait and hard a bond, that (if it were poſſible) they would cry out and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the injury. But flowers thus compacted and ſet in water, live long and flouriſh.</p>
                     <p>By this poſie I underſtand daily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which teach us, at leaſt, to live with more purity, though perchance with leſſe content. As for example: I am very hungry; to relieve my hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I inſinuate with the Cooke: I am thirſty, but love not to draw mine own drink, and therefore make uſe of the Butler: I want apparrell, but know not how to make it, and therefore I employ the Taylor.

                        </gap>rs. If there were ſome that wanted no mans help, they would affoord none ſo much as a good word. After this manner the ſoules of good men are preſerved as it were in the bundle of the living.</p>
                     <p>It is farre otherwiſe with the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they indeed daily ſuffer miſeries,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10478:61"/>
but may be well likened to the ſtones which the ſting circles and wheeles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to throw them further off. The wicked will live in the compaſſe of no lawes, they ſeeke as much liberty as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Chriſt our crucified King, inviting us to carry our croſſe, offered it not for a yeare, moneth or week, but a daily croſſe: and, as Saint Luke teſtifieth, ſaid to all: If any man will come after me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let him deny himſelfe, and take up his croſſe daily, and follow me.</p>
                     <p>I am of Saint Chryſoſtoms minde,

that our life much reſembleth a ſhip of burden, which is haled againſt the ſtreame.

Upon a time, ſaith he, the Fir-tree, &amp; Bramble were at variance; the one greatly reproached the other, in ſo much that they came to ſharpe and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeeches. In fine ſaid the Fir-tree, what need many words? thy greateſt preferment is no higher then to the Oven, or Fornace, thou art good for nothing but for fuell, this is thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall end to which thou wert ordained: heere muſt thou be lodg'd where thou

Thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſaſters which we ſuffer are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable. They all come from the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:10478:69"/>
hand of God, the author of all good things, the head and fountaine, who miniſtreth theſe as bitter potions; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indeed to the taſte but wholſome in operation.</p>
                     <p>Three principal reaſons may be given, why theſe calamities are ſent unto us; for either God exerciſeth the good; chaſtiſeth ſinners, or puniſheth the wicked, and all this for our good. We ſee daily good men have their ſeverall afflictions, or elſe are involved in the ſame together with wicked men. This we often ſee and admire, becauſe we fully comprehend not the cauſe therof, nor obſerve the end. The cauſe and motive is the love of God towards us: the end not prejudiciall but benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unto us, for this exerciſe is many waies profitable. If thou deſireſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a skillfull Mariner, thou muſt be taught by tempeſts: if an expert ſouldier, by dangers, if a ſtout man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, afflictions muſt harden thee: For the learning and experience of a man is known by patience. And to this end are men exerciſed. Another end there is in theſe calamities and afflictions, which are ſent us either to chaſtize us after we have ſinned, or to curbe and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10478:70"/>
withhold us from ſinning. This hand is like that of a mercifull father, which often ſcourgeth thoſe that offend; but the hand of a rigorous executioner pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth ſlowly and but once; Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments ſpecially belong to thoſe that are evill, but they are not evill, as they curbe and reſtraine us from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thus all puniſhment is good in reſpect of juſtice, and impunity evill, which cauſeth the impious to perſever in their wickedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Moreover publike ſlaughters and ruines by warres, famine, plague, and other calamities are juſtly ſent by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; nor have we any cauſe to thinke them new or ſtrange, or more grievous then in former ages.

Certainely every thing appeares unto us according to the figure or cloak we caſt upon it, ſuch I meane as we frame in our imagination. If we inveſt it with a blacke mourning robe, the aſpects therof will be dolefull unto us: If it be glos'd over with a light and pleaſant colour, it will encourage us to imbrace it with an undaunted reſolution.</p>
                     <p>But ſometimes let him, who would not grieve too much, behold the thing it ſelfe naked and undiſguis'd, and that which before threatned death and horrour, will now invite him to laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the like happens to us which to little children, for if they ſee one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10478:76"/>
though they know him very well, and daily uſe to play with him, yet they are affrighted at the ſight. We muſt not onely take from men, but even from things themſelves their diſguiſe, and ſhew them truly as they are. Look, I beſeech you, ſomewhat more narrowly into the matter, what it is for a man to be ſicke, or poore, when it is not through his owne fault: what to have loſt the favour of men. Conſider adviſedly what it is to have injuries offered unjuſtly: think what it is for a vertuous man to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vilified, and you will ſay, that all theſe are but terrible vizards onely to affright babes.</p>
                     <p>Moſt men figure ſickneſſe in their imagination, as the greateſt evill, and poverty as the extreameſt diſhonour in this life; and conceive injuries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, diſgraces, loſſe of favour, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of envious perſons, ſo grievous, that by all means poſſible they are to be avoided. Thus of Ants, we make huge Elephants; of Dogges, Tigers and Panthers; of Hares, formidable troops and ſquadrons of hideous mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. By this means we dye an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred deaths before we are ſo much as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10478:77"/>
in danger of ſickneſſe. And we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine our ſelves poorer then Irus or Codrus, before poverty hath ſet ſo much as one foot within our doores. By this meanes we often cry out, we have loſt the field, and that all things are in deſperate caſe, before we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the enemy; we have no ſooner taſted a little wormewood wine, but we fear we ſhall be overwhelmed and drowned with wormwood: we ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tread on a thorne, and yet dream of wounds and maſſacres. Thus we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye our miſeries, by making them far greater then they are; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, through apprehenſion, make our ſelves more miſerable. Who can rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon up the follies and fopperies of this mortall life? The things that terrifie us are moe in number then thoſe that hurt us: and many times we are not ſo ſick as conceit hath made us. Some things vex us more then they ſhould, ſome before they ſhould, and ſome <note place="margin">

Or as Ceſar ſaid to Brutus; and thou alſo my ſon? when he was ſtab'd in the Senate houſe. But let us here infuſe ſome comfort like Balſamum into the wound.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, tis moſt certain that all men are ſubject to this evill, how wary or holy ſoever they be, they muſt ſuffer &amp; have their part in being laſh't with mens tongues. The ſcourge of the tongue, ſaith the wiſe man, communicating to all. The Prophet Jeremy, a man ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified before his birth, complaines notwithſtanding, and ſayes, Woe be to me, my mother, why haſt thou brought me forth, a man expos'd to diſcord through the whole world? all
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10478:79"/>
men were apt to picke quarrells with him, and lay imprecations and curſes upon him.</p>
                     <p>Iobs ſuffering had not ſeemed ſo great, while he was only tormented by Satan, had not his owne wife and kindred likewiſe cruelly ſcourged him. As ſpices pounded diſperſe their ſweet odours: ſo doth vertue oppreſs'd and perſecuted farre extend her renowne. Yea there are ſome living creatures which, while they are beaten, breathe forth a moſt pleaſing ſent: Such for all the world was Iob, the more ſtripes he received, the ſweeter was the odour of patience which breathed from him. Bleſſed is the man whom God correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: refuſe not therefore the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>

Thou ſhalt bee hidden from the ſcourge of the tongue (ſaith Iob) and thou ſhalt not feare the calamity when it comes. The name agreeth well with the thing it ſelfe: for the ſcourge of the tongue doth not onely ſmart, but likewiſe leaves a marke behind it, that is, a

fowle blot that ſtaines their fame and reputation. Moreover as ſtripes for the moſt part are laid on the backe, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions wound moſt behind our backes.

                     <p>A third comfort is: that by theſe ſtripes our ſinnes are expiated, if they beare theſe ſcourges with patience and modeſty. In times paſt the yong men of Rome in their games of Lupercalia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That was a worthy ſpeech of St. Hierome: Amongſt Chriſtians (ſaith hee) that man is miſerable who effereth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10478:81"/>
injury, not he who ſuffereth it. As Chriſt our Saviour declareth: Bleſſed are you when men ſpeake evill of you, and perſecute you, and ſpeake all the worſt they can againſt you, bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you for my ſake; rejoyce and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult, for your reward is very great in heaven.</p>
                     <p>Saint Peter following this word of our Lord: If you be reproched ſaith he, for the name of Chriſt, you ſhall be bleſſed. This is that whereby you are made like to Chriſt, and become An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. That wiſe woman of Thecua, indevouring to extoll and magnifie with the greateſt praiſe the King of Hebrews, ſaid: My Lord the King is like the Angell of God, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction nor malediction can move him.</p>
                     <p>Saint Gregory doth very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and arme every one againſt theſe tongue-ſcourges. When we are prayſed (ſaith he) or diſpraiſed, we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies have recourſe to our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and if we find not therein the good that is ſpoken of us, with great ſorrow and ſolicitude let us procure to have it: on the other ſide if we find not therein the evill which men object, we
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10478:81"/>
ought very much to rejoyce. For what is it for men to commend us, if our owne conſcience accuſe us? or how little ſhould our griefe be, though all men accuſe us, while our owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells us we are innocent?</p>
                     <p>But ſome will ſay, it grieves me more then may be imagined, to be ſo raſhly ſlandered and belied unjuſtly. Let it grieve thee a Gods name, But what then? to grieve for Chriſt &amp; the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven ſhould be a Chriſtians chiefeſt comfort. Art thou greeved to heare theſe things ſpoken of thee? let it rather trouble thee if they be true, if thy owne conſcience accuſe thee; for then thy converſation makes thee an obloquy to the world. But let him whom his own conſcience defends and aſſures him, that whatſoever aſperſions malevolent people caſt upon him are vaine and falſe, let him (I ſay) not bee contriſtated, whatſoever it be which others ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If Joabs triple Lance, or the fiery two-edg'd ſword of a Cherubim had menaced him, there had beene ſome cauſe of feare. But perhaps it was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10478:82"/>
the writing that terrified him; this he underſtood not, and therfore called o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to expound it. Why then feared he one ſingle hand, one pen, one wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which he underſtood not?</p>
                     <p>Behold how often the like happens among us. There comes a miſchievous detractour, and with his tongue writes as it were upon the wall theſe or the like words: Let none give credit to this man, he is not the man he ſeemes to be, and theſe vices are uſuall with him; he hath a faire outſide, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly he is not the man you take him for. This kinde of writing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo terrifies us, that we take it for one of the greateſt puniſhments that may be: and to deſire, and yet not to be able to revenge, this wrong ſeemes more grievous then death it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>But why, O Chriſtians! doe theſe detracting words ſo much trouble you? upon ſo light a wrong, turne you all your patience into fury. This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Scorpion, provoke him not by touching, &amp; he never darts forth his poyſnous ſting; but if you once touch him, inſtantly he ſtings you with his taile: Thus, many are ſilent, if you doe not vex them, but touch them once, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10478:83"/>
they ſpit fire that blaſtes and conſumes all it lights upon.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe the wiſeſt courſe is to turne a deafe eare to all detractions: you may take example from the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt men.

                     <p>It is reported that Aldegund a Virgin deſcended from royall parents, and from her tender yeares, addicted to all manner of vertues, hearing that ſhe was (much to the offence of ſome of her friends) ſlandered by certaine idle prating companions, beganne ſomewhat to be perplexed in minde. But ſtraightwares an Angel was ſent to comfort her, whoſpake thus unto her: Art thou troubled at the envious pratling of thoſe that beare thee ill will? why regardeſt thou the vaine and fooliſh ſpeeches of men? why reflecteſt thou upon earth or earthly things, thy ſpouſe and judge is in heaven? art thou ready to ſhed thy blood for Chriſt? learne firſt to diſgeſt ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and contumelious words; pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence overcomes all.

                     <p>They write of Zoerardus an ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, that he combated againſt ſleepe in this manner: He fixed many nailes within a hollow tree, eſpecially where he was wont to leane his backe or

Moreover he faſtned over his head a large iron ring, and great ſtones round about it, ſo that which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he nodded his weary head, he found a ſharpe remembrance to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him, a ſtraite and narrow houſe, I confeſſe: but an excellent ſymbole of manifold miſery. Thus are we ſometimes environed with miſeries, that which way ſoever we bend our eyes, or minde, nothing occurres but that which torments us.</p>
                     <p>When Micheas had propheſied contrary to the humour of king A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab, he thus wickedly commanded: Caſt that man in priſon, and feede him with the bread of tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the water of diſtreſſe. Micheas was well acquainted, with the ſacke, for hee was not onely condemned of falſhood, but haled to priſon, derided and afflicted with hunger. This is to bee ſhut up in a ſacke.</p>
                     <p>That moſt holy king David wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this ſacke, as it had been his daily garment: I have ſaid, quoth he, to my ſelfe, my ſoule is troubled, and albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it I endevour with cheerefull thoughts to reduce her to her wonted alacrity,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10478:86"/>
yet ſhe returnes againe to her ſelfe, and falleth into her formerg iefes: depth calleth on depth: ſhowers ruſh upon me out of all quarters: one overtakes another, and all light on me, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity drawes on calamity. All thy high things, and thy waves have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over me; All the world bands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; I am never at reſt: warre begets warre, every where danger and enemies; vexations, loſſes and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, every where great occaſion of miſery. Behold this kingly Prophet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhut up in a ſacke!</p>
                     <p>The holieſt men of all are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put into this ſacke, for they are not onely ſenſible of the evils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they obſerve the dangers, they conſider the damages of the ſoule, they are not ignorant of the deceipts of the goſtly enemy, what a matter it is to fill from Gods grace, and to have him their enemy; when therefore they are deſtitute of divine comforts they feare leaſt peradventure they are excluded alſo from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. By this meanes they are in a ſacke, and perplexed with manifold griefes. For that cauſe likewiſe king D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>vid confeſſeth thus with teares: O

God thou haſt repelled us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed us! Thou haſt ſhewed hard matters to thy people; thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us the wine of compunction to drinke O my Lord! thou giveſt us to drinke out of thy cellar, bitter worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood wine, an exceeding bitter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Much like theſe are the words of Ezechiel. When diſtreſſes comes upon them they ſhall require peace, and it ſhall not bee granted. Trouble ſhall come upon trouble, and report upon report. Calamities ſhall beget cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, we ſhall never be quiet. We ſhall be in a ſacke. Iob (if ever any knew this ſacke or heape of miſeries) was well acquainted with it. I, quoth he, ſometimes that rich man, was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly brought to nothing: he reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my necke, he broke me, and ſet me before him as a ſigne. He hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed me with his launces, he hath wounded my loines; he hath not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, and hath powred out my bowels upon the earth. He hath cut me with wound upon wound. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly that moſt patient man was in a ſacke, but he manifeſtly ſhewed how great a proficient hee was in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:10478:87"/>
Schoole of Patience: certainly he was now to bee counted rather a maſter then a ſcholar.</p>
                     <p>Whoſoever he be that is oppreſſed with this heape of calamities, and groanes to ſee himſelfe ſhut up in this ſacke, let him deeply conſider in his minde theſe two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt that there is a place in the Schoole of Patience a kind of hell, and that thither God ſendeth his ſervants to be incloſed in a ſacke. This is no new thing, but a ſigne of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and a cauſe of more ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But this hell is not eternall, nor this ſacke to bee worre at all houres, or in all ages. It is God who bringeth to hell and bringeth backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                     <p>The other is: That the abſolute will of God is, we ſhould repoſe our greateſt hope and confidence in him, eſpecially when our ſtate is moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. The inſcription of the one and fortie Pſal. is. <hi>Intellectus filiis Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> or <hi>Canticum erudie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore David heere many times inculcateth this: <hi>Spera in Deo,</hi> Hope in God. Why pineſt thou away with vaine griefe? Why art thou vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with feare of events? Why feareſt thou every paſſe of contrary winde? Hope in God thou man of ſlender faith, hope in God. This is a hope that can never deceive, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p>Philo the Hebrew with others of his nation was accuſed by Appion to Caius Caligula the Emperour, that he had not exhibited divine honour to Ceſar. And after when he was baniſhed from the cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But if divine helpe ſeem alſo to be long a coming, we muſt opportunely with king Ioſaphat pray in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: when we know not what elſe to doe, this is our onely refuge, to lift up our eies to thee, O God. So that we ſhould never turne the eies of our minde from God. But herein imitate a watchfull ſpaniell that waiteth upon his maſter, ſometimes ſcrapeth, or
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10478:88"/>
fawneth, or with open mouth beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth till meate be given him: ſo when we are ſhut up in this ſacke and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſundry miſeries, let us implore his aid and helpe, till hee grant our ſuite. Are all humane helps wanting? Divine aſſiſtance, as Philo ſaith, muſt of neceſſity be preſent.</p>
                     <p>The time will come when we ſhall at once behold all the former paſſages of our life. We ſhall then confeſſe as heretofore Themiſtocles did: that we had periſhed if wee had not periſhed: doubtleſſe many by ſuffering a ſlight temporall ſhipwracke, are preſerved from that which is everlaſting. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us be of good courage, and thinke it even ſweet to be in this ſacke for Chriſts ſake.

Old cheeſe indeed hath many faults, but that which is new and tender, many more; whereunto you may very well compare ſome Scholars, which like a ſoft greene Cheeſe, are ſtored with ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, made of nothing elſe but jugling

tolerated in the Schoole of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>We will now briefely explicate theſe eight notorious faults, that we may better beware of them.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>Sect. I.</head>
                     <p>THE firſt fault in ſchooles is to forget their leſſon, or only make a ſhew of knowing it. The uſuall words of the maſter are: Repeat boy, recite your leſſon. But the ſloathfull ſcholar mutters ſoftly to himſelfe; I know it not, or beginnes ſtammeringly, and ſtickes at every third word, lookes by ſtealth into his book, pronounces moſt of the words falſe, and omits ſome. And in truth all this is nothing elſe but groſſe ignorance.</p>
                     <p>Thomas a Kempis, that moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous writer, bringeth Chriſt ſpeaking in this manner. I am accuſtomed by two wayes to viſit my elect, by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſolation. I read unto them every day two lectures, by the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking their vices, by the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to the increaſe of vertue. Thus Chriſt is wont to read to his ſcholars: but when are theſe leſſons to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10478:90"/>
be repeated? In the evening eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they are to examine their conſciences. Here the maſter comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, Repeate, Repeate, how haſt thou bettered or improved thy ſelfe? What vertue haſt thou learned this day? What imperfection haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, what vice haſt thou endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to roote out? Repeat, review and call to minde</p>
                     <p>It belongs not only to religious perſons, but to all whatſoever, to call diligently to minde what every day they have done or ſaid, or thought of. This likewiſe did Anneus, Seneca, Publius Sexius and others out of the light and dictamen of reaſon. This ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">

And what other thing is meant heere by writing, but a due and ſeaſonable premeditation? the mind is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and prepared for future events; leſt calamity with an unexpected ſhocke oppreſſe us unawares. Seneca wiſely admoniſheth us: Let the mind in time of ſecurity prepare it ſelfe for adverſitie. The Souldier, before hee ſees the face of the enemy, exerciſeth himſelfe, raiſeth bulwarkes, caſteth up trenches, and wearieth himſelfe with exceſſive paines, that he may endure neceſſary labours. That which in the encounter it ſelfe thou wouldeſt not be afraid of, make it familiar before the aſſault. Let calamity never take us unprovided.</p>
                     <p>More then once were the three Apoſtles admoniſhed and reprehended by their maſter in mount Olivet. Why ſo? Becauſe they thought the matter was to be debated with their ſwords, when they ſhould have beene peaceable; that they were to fly, when they were to ſtand to it; to ſleep when they ſhould have watched and prayed. They prepared not themſelves for that which was to come, albeit Chriſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exhorted them, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> watch
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10478:94"/>
and pray leaſt you enter into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the ſpirit indeed is prompt, but the fleſh infirme. But they neither watched nor prayed and ſo a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine whirle winde tooke them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe man much commending this premeditation ſaith: Sonne when thou comeſt to the ſervice of God, ſtand in juſtice and in fear, and prepare thy mind againſt temptations. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected diſaſters fall moſt heavilie, and even the newneſſe it ſelfe addes a great waight to calamity. But that which is daily look'd for, is more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable when it comes. No accident ſhould befall us unprovided: our mind ſhould preoccupate them, and thinke rather what may, then what is wont to fall out.</p>
                     <p>Let our mind clearly underſtand, and patiently ſuffer its peculiar ſtate and condition, knowing whatſoever happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to one, may alſo happen to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Make account then with thy ſelfe, if thou art a ſcholar in this ſchoole, to ſuffer much: ſeemes it ſtrange to any one to be cold in winter? ſick at ſea? yogged to and fro in a coach? ſpotted and bemired in a durty way? That
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:10478:94"/>
mind is moſt couragious that goes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for all.</p>
                     <p>But there are a ſort of ſcholars, who deliver up a theame written, which is none of their owne: they copie it out of others. And this among Chriſtians is done after this manner. There are ſome ſo reſolute in upholding their owne ſlouth, that you can no ſooner admoniſh or correct them, but they preſently reply: am I onely reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? neither this man, nor that, nor the other take theſe things otherwiſe: you ſhall never ſee ſuch a man beare theſe kind of words patiently; another you know that will endure no jeſt, &amp; a third is ſenſible of the leaſt diſgrace; theſe men dare oppoſe themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like occaſions; theſe (and they have good reaſon for it) are not ready to fall at every mans foote. Why is not this as lawfull for me, as for this man, or that? ſhall I alone be tyed to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conditions then other men?</p>
                     <p>An ill argument, and as ill tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd. Thus we, as it were, copy out other mens conditions, and imitate them in ours; thus we faſhion our ſelves by bad paternes, and are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to periſh with the multitude. O

                     <p>THE eight fault in Schooles is, to lye or murmur when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10478:101"/>
Theſe are capitall faults in ſchools, &amp; deſerve no leſſe puniſhment then the rod. Impatience is as great a fault in the School of Patience, as a lye in the School of Grammar or Syntax. For as a lye denies what ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and affirmes what ſhould be denyed, making blacke white, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience makes a ſmall trouble great, and a great one inſupportable. And this is the original cauſe of impatience; namely, when a man thinkes himſelfe overcharged with burdens inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and vexed (being innocent) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly. So iniquity belyeth it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>How much better were it for every one that is afflicted to reaſon thus with himſelfe: What ſayſt thou, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient man, is it for this that thou haſt entred thy name in the Schoole of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to proclaime thy ſelfe innocent when thou ſuffereſt any thing? Away with theſe complaints; there is nothing thou ſuffereſt, but what thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved an hundred, a thouſand, yea, ten thouſand times.

Alas good ſoule! thou ſmoothly, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply flattereſt thy ſelfe: fooliſh credulity perſwades thee thou art a ſheep, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeede thou art a wolfe. Hence proceed theſe pittifull complaints: why falls every ſtorme upon my head? what ſinnes have I committed? what have I done? I will tell thee; if thou wilt but heare me with patience. It is reported by one Anthony, that Peter a holy man, afterward martyred, was accuſed before his Superiour for that certaine profane people were ſeene and heard to prattle in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For which cauſe Peter was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to accuſe himſelfe publikely in the preſence of all the monaſtery, and exactly to performe the penance which others ſhould enjoyne him. This he did; but to ſay the truth, much againſt his will, for he knew he had not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in offended, and that upon falſe ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions this was forged againſt him. Wherefore after he had retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into his chamber, with teares in

his eyes, he preſented himſelfe before a Crucifix, and to eaſe his minde with complaints, ſaid; Lord, what have I done, that being innocent I ſhould ſo ſeverely be puniſhed?

                     <p>The brothers of Ioſeph vice-roy of Egypt, were innocent, when they were recalled from their journey to be caſt in priſon for ſtealing a ſilver cup. What ſhall we ſay in this caſe? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

the cup they were altogether innocent, but all is not gold that gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. They had committed a farre greater theft. It was not a ſilver cup, but their owne brother Ioſeph, whom they had ſtolne from his father. And this was the theft committed above twenty yeares before, which was now at laſt to be puniſhed. The like often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens unto others.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore love the truth, and whatſoever we ſuffer, ſay with the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Ioſeph: worthily doe we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe things, becauſe we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

                     <p>When Rebecca the wife of Iſaac felt two infants ſtrugling in her womb, ſhe went to conſult with our Lord. This anſwer was returned. Two nations are in thy wombe, &amp;c. and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger. From hence Saint Auguſtine raiſing a great queſtion, asketh how this came to paſſe, for it evidently appeared that the elder never ſerved the younger, but contrariwiſe went about to kill him. For Eſau had determined thus in his mind; The daies will come of the mourning of my father, and I will kill Iacob my brother. How then did he ſerve him, when hee went about to kill him? whereunto Saint Auguſtine anſwereth very well: He will ſerve him (ſaith he) not by obeying but by perſecuting him, after the ſame manner as evill men ſerve good men. As the file ſerves the iron, the hammer the gold, the mill the wheat, and the oven the bread in baking it.</p>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:10478:114"/>
Come forth you enemies of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I, nor any of mine wil ever ſhrink, or refuſe to fight with you: and albeit, your ſide ſo far exceeds us in number, yet we fear you not: Draw forth your ſtrongeſt armies, we are confident, God fights on our ſide. Juſt after the ſame manner doth the couragious Chriſtian provoke his enemies: Come hither, you afflictions, you innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble troops of calamities; hunger, thirſt, poverty, diſeaſes, griefs, injuries, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and all kinde of miſeries: I fear neither your number, nor your ſtrength: If whole camps ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us our heart ſhall not be afraid; the faith we have pledged to God, we will never break; we are ready rather to ſuffer all that may be inflicted upon us, yea, death it ſelf; and if we had an hundered lives, rather would loſe them all, then violate our oath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have bound our ſelves to God.</p>
                     <p>Every man that is pious and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully devoted to God, is of this minde: Although the whole power of hell ſhould ſtand againſt me, the heavens fall upon me; yea, though all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the world ſhould ſhew the utmoſt of their rage and malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

me, yet would I, by Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſtand conſtant and unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in my faith. I am ready for Gods cauſe to be caſt in priſon, burned, ſlain, or ſlaughtered. For if we be dead with him, we ſhall live alſo together; if we ſuſtain, we ſhall alſo reigne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; if we deny, he alſo will deny us.</p>
                     <p>And let us aſſure our ſelves (O Chriſtians!) that it is not ſufficient for us to be members of Chriſts-Church, to hear Divine Service, to faſt, or pray, or give alms; but of neceſſity, God ſhould finde us faithfull and worthy, as he found Abraham, Joſeph, and Job, truly faithfull and worthy of him in the midſt of whatſoever adverſity. For as the hiſtory of the Machabees teſtifieth; Joſeph in all the time of his adverſitie kept the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Albeit we be of ſilver or gold, if we be impatient, and brook not the hammer, we are but little worth. And euen as in a mans body, when he is ſuddenly frighted, or his heart fails him, all his bloud runs to comfort and ſuccour that diſtreſſed part: So in all anguiſhes and afflictions whatſoever,

all the vertue of a juſt man recollects it ſelf, and animates him after this manner: If thou fail now, when God goes about to make a triall of thee, where is thy faith, where thy love?

Democritus anſwered, that the Kings demand was important and difficult; nevertheleſſe, he would effect it, if his Majeſty firſt would and could fulfill a requeſt of his, which was, to engrave upon his dead friends tomb, the names of thirty young men, who had lived to the age of twenty yeares, without any croſſe or calamity.

All our life is repleniſhed with griefes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.

                     <p>IT is a wonderfull comfort to thoſe that are in miſery, to have compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their puniſhments, to know that others ſuffer the like, or greater; that none eſcape, or are exempted from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.

Chriſt inſtructing his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, gave them this note: Bleſſed are ye (ſaith he) when they ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, &amp;c. For ſo they perſecuted the Prophets that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. And that he might give them a clearer teſtimony: If they have, ſaith he, perſecuted me, you alſo will they perſecute. By the ſame meanes, Saint Paul comforting the Macedonians, ſaith: For you, brethren, are become followers of the Churches of God that be in Jewry, in Chriſt Jeſus: for you alſo have ſuffered the ſame things of your owne linage. So he pointet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And that we may the better be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the exemplar and generous patience of others, Saint James wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us to think, that they who ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo great torments and miſeries,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10478:117"/>
were not men either of Iron or Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. Elias was a man like unto us, paſſible: Neither this man, nor that, nor any one of the reſt, but were as ſenſible of pain as we; but for that they had profited better in the School of Patience, they were more patient then we. Nor do the examples only of the afflicted, but their words alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort us in affliction. For in adverſitie, we learne to commiſerate others in the like; to comfort them, and eaſily to credit thoſe who are ſubject to the like adverſities. And this is one of the principall cauſes why we are ſhut up in the School of Patience, and lye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſo many afflictions, that we may learne one to condole with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Aſſuredly he that hath lived in poore eſtate, findeth no difficulty to compaſſionate anothers hunger and want; he that hath been ſick, and ill diſpoſed in his health, eaſily pittieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers infirmity; He that hath found by experience, what it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, oppreſſed and diſgraced, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerates thoſe who ſuffer like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts; he that is ſtripped out of all his lands and poſſeſſions, quickly takes compaſſion of them that have ſuffered
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:10478:117"/>
the like. After we have been vexed with many miſeries, we gain this knowledge with the Tyrian Queen, who ſaid:</p>
                     <q>Non ignara mali, miſeris ſuccurrere diſco,</q>
                     <q>I learn by harms to ſuccour miſeries.</q>
                     <p>Aeſchilus the Poet ſaith wiſely, that every one is ready to condole and ſigh for company, with thoſe that are in miſery; but this griefe never toucheth them to the quick. To this we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex that ſaying of Sophocles: They only grieve at others afflictions, who have felt the like themſelves.</p>

                     <p>FRom hence we may well conclude, that whomſoever we ſee ſevere, ſharp, unmercifull or cruell, hath doubtleſſe never been put to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties himſelfe; he knowes neither hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity nor civill demeanour, and is ſo farre from combating, that he hath never ſo much as ſeen the liſts, but hath ſpent his time in caſe and delicacies, and by this means is become ſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and mercileſſe. For this cauſe God admoniſheth his people, that they ſhould not wrong aliens nor ſtrangers, becauſe they themſelves had been of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:10478:118"/>
the like condition: Thou ſhalt not moleſt a ſtranger, nor afflict him: for you your ſelves were likewiſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the land of Egypt. Let your owne experience tell you, how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a ſtate it is, to be a ſtranger, a captive, ſurcharged with labour, and loaded with ſtripes.</p>
                     <p>Saint Leo is of opinion, that Saint Peter a chiefe Apoſtle was ſuffered to fall ſo grievouſly, that he might ſo much the more tenderly commiſerate ſinners, and that a remedy by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance might be followed in him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the maſter of the family was much offended with his ſervant, for that being himſelfe greatly indebted but a little before, and owing more then he was worth, nevertheles, would not have the leaſt commiſeration of his fellow ſervant, that was indebted to him: Oughteſt not thou alſo to have mercy upon thy fellow ſervant?</p>
                     <p>Hence came it, that Saint Paul alſo greatly comforting us, ſaid: For we have not a high Prieſt that cannot take compaſſion on our infirmities, but tempted in all things. Let us go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10478:118"/>
Whereupon he ought in all things to be like unto us his brethren, that he might become a mercifull and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full high Prieſt before God.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe God ſends afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to many, that they may learn to commiſerate and relieve others more readily. You ſhall hear many blame themſelves in this reſpect: I thought that ſick perſon counterfetted; I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took compaſſion of that poor mans eſtate; I never pittied ſuch an one that was in ſorrow and affliction; I laughed at another who wept and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the death of his friends: Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore am I now viſited with ſickneſſe, ſurcharged with poverty, tears and ſorrows; by this means I ſhall learn hereafter to take compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of others.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet Hieremy taxeth the Moabites for their lewd conditions, after this ſort: Moab was fertile in her youth, and reſted in her dregs, ſhe was not powred out of one veſſell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another. He compareth the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites to wine, which, being long mixed with dregs, becomes muſty &amp; unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

In a word, they had never been Scholers in the School of Patience; onely trained up in eating, drinking, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Abſtinence likewiſe and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are taught in the School of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. We perſwade our ſelves, whilſt we poſſeſſe many things, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without them; but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them, we our ſelves marvell with how little difficulty we ſpare them. Take for example, a merchant, who, whiles he is rich, goes like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, magnificently attended; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown poor and needy, begins to finde how eaſie it is to go without a train. A traveller being benighted, and forced, for want of an inne, to take up his lodging under ſome tree in the field; and for ſupper, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with one poor farthings worth of bread, is compelled at laſt, to confeſſe, that he knew not til this time how to ſup for leſſe then two pence. A tradeſman who formerly was weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and fared daintily, ſometimes, through negligence in his trade, breaks, and becomes a banquerupt, and is content at laſt to ſit down to a dinner of cabbidge or carrets; and for want of ſupper, either faſts, or
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10478:120"/>
contents himſelf with a meſſe of homely water gruell: By this means, he (poor man) wondering at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſayes: I never thought I could have lived ſo frugally. A Carrier, in like manner, who was wont to ride in time of his proſperity, is, by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftineſſe and drinking, forced to go on foot, and ſayes: God be thanked, who hath once more brought me to my feet; I knew not before what foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip I had.</p>
                     <p>Thus God dealeth with many, by wholeſome want reducing them to the golden mean of temperance. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, you ſhall finde ſome ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and blinded in their opinion, that one will not ſtick to ſay: My ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack will by no means indure faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Another, that his weak body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more ſleep then ordinary: This man that he cannot poſſibly lead his life without company: And another, without wine and ſtrong bear, thinks he is like a fiſh without water. But when poverty, or ſome other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, bereaves them of their companions or ſleep, and turns their wine into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then experience teacheth, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie a thing it is to watch, to give the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:10478:120"/>
belly no more then his due, to obſerve faſting dayes, and take their leave both of wine and companie.</p>
                     <p>Calamity is the Miſtris of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. By poverty, we learn ſobriety, and frugality, which often comes too late, when all is waſted and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. I my ſelf have known many perſons of quality, whom the priſon hath taught to dine for ſix pence, and ſometimes for leſſe, whoſe tables here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore have been loaden with dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>Give ear to a ſtrange, yea wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtrange ſtory, which makes very ſit for this purpoſe. Pecchius an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant on this ſide the Alps, a man of great courage and induſtry, incurred the diſpleaſure of a certain Noble man of great power and wealth. And being one day riding upon the way, was by a train taken; and, like a cat, ſhut up in a ſack, and ſo carried to his enemies caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Here Pecchius was thrown into a deep and loathſome dungeon. And, without acquainting any other, charge was given to a ſervant of ſome truſt, to feed him every day with no more then a ſmall cruſt of bread, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:10478:121"/>
cup of water, wherby this wretched man might ſenſibly ſuffer a lingering death, rather then preſerve a long life. In the mean ſeaſon, Pecchius was ſought for all about, in towns and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and no where found, ſave onely his horſe he rode on, ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled with bloud, which cauſed ſtrong ſuſpition of murder, and the murderer thereupon was diligently ſought after. Two men, with whom it was known he had former quarrels, were laid hold on, and compelled by moſt cruell torments to confeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of his death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judgement paſt upon the innocent perſons, the one to be hanged, the other to loſe his head. Thy judgements (O my God!) are a bottomleſſe abyſſe.</p>
                     <p>Mean while, Pecchius prolonged his miſerable dayes in this loathſome priſon; and in this courſe of life, or rather death, ſpent nineteen yeers; without ever changing or putting off his apparell; and having nothing to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain life, but a poor pittance of bread and water every day. Nevertheleſſe, he himſelf, with grateful acknowledge ment of Gods ſpeciall favour, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confeſſed, that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

very confident hee ſhould at laſt be delivered from this den of death. But his children, during his impriſonment, as if he had been dead, performed all rites and obſequies, and parted the inheritance among them. So when he had accompliſhed nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yeers in this cruell impriſonment, the Lord of the Caſtle, his capitall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his heir, that ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, going about to enlarge and beautifie the Caſtle, commanded walls to be beaten down here and there, till they came at length to this cave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ground, which had no door, but onely a very narrow hole to paſſe into it; here they found this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man like a Stygian ghoſt, with garments torn, his beard grown to his k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At this ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſo unexpected, the workmen ſtood amazed; the rumour thereof was ſtraight divulged abroad; thither a multitude of people ran, as to ſee a Faune or Satyre, or ſome ſuch ſavage monſter.

Whereunto he made anſwer in order, as all things had paſſed, which he audience quickly beleeved according to his relation. Hereupon, he was not onely reſtored to his liberty, but his eſtate alſo, which his children had divided amongſt them, was by the Princes command ſurrendered unto him. One thing here is of great conſequence, and much to bee noted, Pecchius, when he was caſt into the priſon, was troubled with the gout; but this exceeding ſpare diet, wrought a cure of him; ſo that not onely in the priſon, but all the dayes of his life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">

Who is he that will not look about him when he is awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by poverty, ignominy, and havock made of all he hath? One evill drives out another. If thou wouldeſt not have a ſicke man meddle with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome meat, the beſt way is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to ſet it before him, or elſe ſo to pepper and ſalt it, that he ſhall have no pleaſure to taſte it. God carefully goes about to cure us, and by peppering and ſalting our affaires with miſeries, makes thoſe things unſavoury which he knowes are ready to bring us to deſtruction. Saint Auguſtine reputing this a ſingular benefit, ſaith: He that is reſtrained from iniquity, is overcome moſt to his owne advantage. And this he had experienced in himſelfe. I have not eſcaped (ſaid he) thy ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for what mortall man hath ever been free from them? Thou wert al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

                     <p>This God doth, that we may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh our miſeries to our owne deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This cauſeth me (O you wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton worldlings!) to ſee and not to envie your delights: for without all queſtion they are inwardly ſoundly ſalted and peppered. Let him taſte, that hath a minde to be burned. God, like an expert Cooke, ſeaſoneth with ſuch unſavoury ſawce, thoſe meats that are unwholſome, or too cold, as Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers, Muſhromes, Melons and red Beets, that we may be well contented to forbeare them. And in ſtead of this dangerous &amp; wanton fare, ſends us of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes royall diſhes from his owne table.</p>
                     <p>It might have ſeemed a great favour when David King of Jeruſalem (as the ſecond book of Kings recounteth) ſent diſhes from his owne table to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Urias; The Kings meate follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him. Nebuchodonoſor in like ſort, appointed the foure Hebrew chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a certain proviſion for every day,

To be born, to live, to die in extream neceſſity: My meat, ſaith our Saviour, is to do the will of him that ſent me, to performe his buſineſſe. What buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is this? to be daily crucified. For Chriſt our Lord, the very firſt moment that he tooke up his habitation in the wombe of the bleſſed virgin, knew he was to be crucified; ſo that all the time of his life he was crucified through the daily memory of his death. And hence came it, that going about to make triall, as it were, of his two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſonnes to Zebedeus, he ſaid unto them: Can you drinke the chalice whereof I am to drinke? that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice I mean which my Father hath given unto me, that chalice which of all other is moſt bitter. Hee that ſaith hee cannot, let him learn to drinke it in the Schoole of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>Let us accuſtome our ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to lay aſide ſuperfluities, let or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meat ſatisfie our hunger, and drinke, our thirſt. Let us learne to be
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:10478:126"/>
maſters of our ſelves, and not to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate new fangled cookery in our diet, or faſhion in our apparrell: Let us uſe our ſelves to ſup without choyce companions, or dainty diſhes; to weare apparrell rather warm and fit, then fine and coſtly, and to content our ſelves with mean habitations. Let us learne every day to be more continent then other, to reſtraine ſenſuality, to moderate our appetites, pacifie our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with patience to embrace poverty, live frugally, and foreſee our neer approching eternity. All this is to be learned in the Schoole of Patience; but by them onely that are willing and induſtrious. In the mean time let us make good uſe of this maxime; Not to be dejected with adverſitie, nor too confident in proſperity. It is the part of a wiſe man to beware of doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and of a valiant to beare with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration what is paſt recalling, though not amending.</p>

Prayer is a faire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moſt ſelected Roſe; but yet, if it be not accompanied with thorns of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, the ſent it breathes will be nothing ſo odoriferous.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, if thou art milde, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt no man; yet if unchaſte, thou marreſt the muſick, and art guilty of all. Wherefore ſing unto our Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Harp, upon the Harp well tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on all the ſtrings. Such as thy life is, ſuch ſhall be thy prayer.</p>
                     <p>The other Point is: In voice of Pſalme. He would have the naturall vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce joyned with muſicall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but if there be but one note ſung out of tune, the whole ſong runs on diſcords. He that ſets himſelf to prayer, let him underſtand what he ſayes: True prayer ought to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive and ſerious.</p>
                     <p>The third: On Sackbuts. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is not made nor faſhioned without many blows, and much ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, which ſignifies mortification. It is more difficult for a man to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10478:128"/>
himſelf, then the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemy in the world. The victory can never be glorious, where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat is not laborious. He that ſeverely ſubdueth himſelf, both makes and playes upon the Sackbut.</p>
                     <p>The fourth point: And voice of Cornet. A ſmall and narrow inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſweet and artificiall, if it be winded by a skilfull Corneteer. Here we are admoniſhed to faſt and give a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ms. Therefore prayer is good, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with faſting and alms. That prayer is good which is accompanied with mortification. Often times we praiſe God with muſicall harmony, but all in vain, and without either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments or organs: we pray, but chaſtiſe not our carnall concupiſeen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Many cozen themſelves with this deceit, who, becauſe they pray much and often, deem themſelves men of much prayer. Is it ſo indeed, my friends, are you ſuch excellent fingers? I grant, a voice alone is delightfull: but where are your Sackbuts, where your inſtruments, where your Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets? Prayer doth well, but where is your mortification? Theſe muſt be joyned, otherwiſe your harmony is all
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:10478:128"/>
in vain. Sing unto our Lord, but upon the Harp; Chriſt taught us not onely to offer up our prayers, but to hate our lives alſo; at mount Olivet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Diſciples not onely to pray, but likewiſe to watch, and not without ſome conflict to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their ſleep. Prayer and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification are taught in the School of Patience.</p>

                     <p>The Apoſtles ſeeing themſelves in a ſhip ready to be ſunk, implored Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aid. The Deer, when the hounds

So it is with us, as long as our affairs ſucceed according to our hearts deſire, we uſe not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune God with any importunate clamours; either we pray not at all, or at moſt, after a cold maner; but when the whole cry of hounds is at our heels, then we mend our pace, then we run to ſee what Sanctuary we can recover; when we are heated and overcharged with miſeries, or waſhed with ſhowers of tears, then we cry out, and invocate the Almighty God; To this man God may well ſay; Thou wouldſt never have had recourſe to me, had I not as a father called thee to an account under the rod.

Oh Pharaoh! knoweſt thou our Lord now? Doubtleſſe thou wert taught this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, whether thou wouldeſt or no, in the Schoole of Patience.</p>

                     <p>God therefore oftentimes moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignly ſtaies this fierce flinging jade, in the midſt of his courſe, laying in his way calamities, loſſe of goods, and all the miſeries which are moſt to be feared, to ſtop and reclaime this headſtrong and untamed colt.

even forced to ſubjection. To tame a horſe, or oxe, a camel, elephant, lion, or aſpe, mans indeavour is neceſſary: let man therefore have recourſe to God for the taming of himſelf. For our Lord, to bring us to ſubjection, hath his ſcourges, and moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deals with us, as we do with beaſts, which we tame and bring under with bridles, whips and ſpurs; yea, ſomtimes we ſet upon them with long poles and dung forks: and if God deal thus with us, what cauſe have we to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? We are no other then Gods Beaſts. This David plainly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth: Man when he was in honour, underſtood it not; he was compared to fooliſh beaſts, and became like unto them.

If thy beaſt (ſaith Saint Auguſtine) ſuffer himſelf to be broken or tamed by thee, what reward may he expect? Thou wilt not ſo much as bury him when he is dead.

This is the hope for which man is reclaimed, and ſhall we think the reclaimer unſufferable? For this hope alone man is chaſtiſed, and ſhall we murmur againſt ſo profitable a chaſtiſer, if perchance he performe it with ſcourges? At leaſt, let us be as wiſe as horſes and oxen, which when they be put into the cart, wain, coach, chariot or plough, and laſhed with the whip, or pricked with the goad, they know it is done either becauſe they are out of the way, or go on ſlackly: and therefore either th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IT was excellently well ſaid of Saint Chryſoſtome; (that golden mouth of his makes the thing it ſelf moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to our eyes) If you pleaſe (ſaith he) let us deſcribe two houſes; in the one a marriage celebrated, the other repleniſhed with mourners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, view them both, and judge which is the better. You ſhall finde the houſe of mourners full of wiſdom,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:10478:133"/>
but that of marriage full of confuſion. For there, as I have heard and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are looſe and diſordered ſpeeches, diſſolute laughter, laſcivious talk, proud and diſdainfull behaviour, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous fare, pompous apparell, riot and exceſſe in all things. Here glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, pride and drunkenneſſe, domineer as goddeſſes; here Bacchus and Venus have their habitation; here with one voyce they cry; This day we may be even mad-merry.</p>
                     <p>Thus men degenerate into bruit beaſts; they drink and devour like ſwine, kick and wince like aſſes, and neigh like horſes. You would ſay they were in the School of Intemperance, the Academy of all laſciviouſneſſe, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude and wickedneſſe. I condemne not marriages (ſaith St. Chryſoſtome) but the abuſes uſuall at marriages: the devills pomp, cymballs, pipes, ſongs full of fornication, adultery and ſuch like ſongs full of ribauldry. But you ſhall have none of this in the houſe of mourning; there all things are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and well compoſed, much reſt, deep ſilence, the memory of death, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future things, true wiſdom, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inordinate, nothing diſſolute.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10478:134"/>
No man ſpeaketh here, but ſoftly, briefly and modeſtly. Such is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of grief and mourning; they teach us to be wiſe, and to apply our ſelves to modeſty and a profitable courſe of life.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore much better to go to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of feaſting. From the one we return more modeſt and holy; from the other more wanton, fooliſh and wicked. And even as a body full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and bloud, ſurcharged with groſneſſe, is but an hoſpitall full of diſeaſes, unleſſe it be accuſtomed to labour and ſpare diet, which preſerves it long from ſickneſſe: ſo a mans minde becomes effeminate and prone to vices, amidſt dances and delicacies, except it be brought under by cares and griefs, which commonly free us from vices, and make us ſtronger and more lively to encounter adverſity.</p>
                     <p>Behold how mourning and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppreſſe all immodeſty and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of behaviour; and for this cauſe God ſends us ſorrows and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to clip our wings, leſt we ſhould, like untamed birds, flie from his protection.</p>

And to what end ſhould we deny this, ſeeing our own conſcience bears witneſſe againſt us?

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:10478:137"/>
himſelfe thus: He took with him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his cloak, a great bundell of rods, as a preſent for the maſter; and to his ſon he ſaid: Come hither my childe, thou muſt go along with me to the Schoole. The School-maſter at that time, was one Nicolas Sleeger, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous man, unto whom this Citizen preſented his childe, ſaying: To you, ſir, I deliver this ſon of mine, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in good literature; I beſeech you to accept him, as ſpecially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to your care and charge. Thus much onely I intreat you, that if he ſhew himſelfe diſobedient, you would make no ſpare of the rod; and with that, opening his cloak, offered unto him a good bundell of rods, promiſing freely, that when he had ſpent thoſe, he would furniſh him with more. This is to bring up children carefully, and as they ſhould be, for their greater good. This was recounted by Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Boſquier, that famous Preacher, of the order of Saint Francis, who was then a boy taught at the ſame Schoole in Houdan.</p>
                  <p>Salomon diſcourſing of the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, ſaith: Fooliſhneſſe is gathered together in the heart of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:10478:137"/>
and the rod of diſcipline will drive it away. Chriſt, the wiſeſt Schoolmaſter of all, who perfectly underſtands our diſpoſitions, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim us from all childiſh wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſpares not the rod: for he ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth every childe that he receiveth; yea, as the wiſe man ſaith, he maketh ſcourges daily and familiar unto him: But this is the benefit which children have by being ſcourged: for fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe gathered together in their heart, is driven away by the rod of diſcipline. And ſo they learn Prudence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, or Humility, as we ſhall now declare.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>Sect. I.</head>
                     <p>AND firſt adverſitie and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment teacheth us Prudence. The Prophet Ezechiel ſaw a wonderfull beaſt, which had foure ſeverall faces, a Mans, an Oxes, a Lyons, and an Eagles. And when this appeared to him the ſecond time, he ſaw in ſtead of the Oxe, the Angelicall face of a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim What was the meaning of this? What relation hath an Oxe to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or Cherubim? Thou will ſay,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10478:138"/>
perhaps, it was not the ſame creature that appeared, but ſome other. Not ſo, but the very ſame; witneſſe Ezechiel himſelfe: It was, ſaith he, the very ſame beaſt which I had ſeen neer to the river Chobar. By what meanes therefore was the face of an Oxe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the face of an Angel?</p>
                     <p>In the Hebrew tongue, Cherubim is as much to ſay, as Maſter, or a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of knowledge and ſcience. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the very meaning; We have now laid open the whole myſtery: An Oxe, with the Ancients, was the ſymbole of labour, which this creature, of his own nature, is moſt apt to endure: for he is put to Waines, Ploughes and Carts, he is fit to till the ground, to draw, yea even to threſh and tread out the corn; inſomuch that he is the expreſſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of a laborious man. And to ſuch an Oxe as this the Spirit of God aſſigneth the face of a Cherubim, whereby he decipheteth a maſter, and a man of long experience. The reaſon is given by the wiſe man: The man that is expert in many things, will have his thought upon many matters, and he that hath learned many things, will manifeſtly diſcover underſtanding.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10478:138"/>
Here, doubtleſſe, the wiſe man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth experience, which is gotten by many afflictions: he of himſelfe is the beſt interpreter: He who is not tempted, ſaith he, what knowes he?</p>
                     <p>By this it manifeſtly appeares, that affliction is the mother not onely of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall joy, but likewiſe of Chriſtian Prudence. Affliction putteth a taper into the hands of Wiſedome: The wiſe man confirming this by his owne example, ſaith: I have ſeen many things by erring, &amp;c. Sometimes I have hazarded even to death for the cauſe of theſe; to wit, in ſeeking after wiſedome. Behold how the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins face aboliſheth the Oxes, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience drawn from miſeries, is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Prudence! By that which a man ſuffereth, he begins to know both himſelfe and others, yea and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; whileſt he conſidereth the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tranſitory things, the variety of humane diſpoſitions, the inconſtancie and mutability of fortune, the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable frauds and deceits, and the infinite miſeries and calamities of this life. And by this meanes he learns by little and little to eſchew evill, and make choyce of good. Whoſoever he

And he maketh this anſwer to himſelfe. Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of thoſe that lead their lives ſweetly. Aſſuredly that active wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which pointeth out directly, how much tranſitory, how much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall things are to be eſteemed, is not to bee found in houſes which are bleſſed with wealth and abundance, where the cuſtome is to live in daily feaſting and banqueting: heere riches and abundance, careleſneſſe, folly, and madneſſe, goddeſſes nearely allyed, are alwaies familiar and near at hand. For what, I beſeech you, may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more fooliſh, then to rejoyce at the gaine of vile and tranſitory things, and to loſe eternall? S. Gregory affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſame, ſaith: they are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:10478:139"/>
ſo much the more ſtupid and fooliſh, as things are of greater value which they loſe, &amp; of leſſe which they enjoy.</p>

It is a certaine thing, high, royall, invincible, infati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable; it is without ſaciety, without repentance, immortall. You ſhall find her in the Church, at the tribunall, in the court, and ſometimes ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wals of the city, all beſmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with duſt, and died in her owne bloud, with her hands all bliſtred, hard and brawny, with labour. The Hebrew wiſe man warmed with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpirit ſaith, the rod and correction giveth wiſdome.</p>

                     <p>TOBY with the gall of a fiſh was recovered of his blindneſſe. The gally bitterneſſe of calamity is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and ſureſt medicine, to recover that dimme and decayed ſight, which ſees not how miſerable all this our life is, how ſhort and full of errours, how repleniſhed with griefes, alwaies the next door to death, and ready to fall

in a moment which ſees not with what labour and ſollicitude an eternall and better life muſt bee ſought after: to heale, I ſay, and take away this dimneſſe of the eies, there is no medicine of more force, none more wholeſome, then affliction. For a man that is ſick, or in miſery deſcendeth at laſt into himſelfe, and makes theſe objections: Behold the deceits of the world! this is all the reward it gives thee; this is all the ſee thou muſt look for: this is that thou ſo earneſtly ſoughteſt after; content thy ſelfe now with what thou haſt gotten; it was a potion of thine owne making; drinke as thou haſt brewed. And ſeeſt thou not, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou not at length, what a ſtench, what a bitterneſſe, this foule pleaſure leaves behinde it?

Thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:10478:140"/>
thy ſelfe ſo indeed; thou falleſt, before thou art ſcarcely touched. Art thou that magnanimous, that patient, that ſtout and conſtant undertaker, who with Peter ſworeſt to goe to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and to death, and art thou thus with a poore puffe of winde over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne? Hath the enemy even bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted thee with a looke? Thus a man adviſeth and exhorteth himſelfe in time of affliction.</p>
                     <p>See, I beſeech you, how the gall of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction cleareth the eies that are dim, how it openeth thoſe that are ſhut. Hieremie the Prophet plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes this in theſe expreſſe words: He hath ſent fire from above into my bones, and hath inſtructed me. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was a moſt true ſaying of Saint Gregory: that puniſhment opens thoſe eies which ſinne had cloſed.</p>
                     <p>I am a man ſeeing mine owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, in the rod of thy indignation. Thou haſt chaſtized me, and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed like an untamed young man, becauſe thou art my Lord God.</p>
                     <p>Many times we are wretched and miſerable, and which goeth beyond all miſery, are ignorant of our owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and deem thoſe our enemies who
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10478:141"/>
eſteeme us ſuch. In this reſpect we do like unto them, who will never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their houſe to be on fire, as long as they can keepe it cloſe, and ſmoother it within the wals: but ſo ſoone as it flames out at the windows, and makes havocke of the houſe, then they call for helpe of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; when the matter may no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be concealed, and the fire it ſelfe begins to ſpeake. So we never wax wiſe by adverſity, till we ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it. It is only vexation that gives underſtanding. For, as the wiſe man ſaith, he that vexeth the eie fetcheth teares, and he that vexeth and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the heart, makes it ſenſible. Let a man be diſparaged with ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine contumely, affronted with ſome unexpected injury, transfixed with ſome unlooked for calamity; then the time is come to make triall of him. Then will it appeare, how mild this man is being ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ken with ſuddain ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, how pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent, how modeſt, and how mindfull of true humility. And albeit he trip and ſtumble a little, yet will he, if he be wiſe, forthwith recollect himſelfe, gather ſence and underſtanding out of that vexation,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:10478:141"/>
diſcover patience, exerciſe mildneſſe, and make ſhew of modeſty For the ſcourge and doctrine, ſaith the wiſe man, are at all times wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>All the writings, in a manner, of Anneus Seneca, breath a kind of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, worthy to be written in gold and cedar: notwithſtanding the principall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, &amp; which ſeemeth to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge unto it ſelfe a preeminence above the reſt, is that which is he wrot to his mother Helv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a, he being then in baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So we may ſee this Roman wiſe man was indued with more wiſdome, when hee had leſſe fruition of thoſe things which ſhould ſolace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him. So the ſcholars daily profit in the Schoole of Patience, become more prudent, and are inſtructed by the ſtripes of adverſity. So the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher after the ſting of the ſcorpion, learnes wiſdome by his own harmes.</p>
                     <p>Some relate, that a certaine Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, too greedy of his prey, laid hands with more haſte then good ſpeed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his net, whence being ſtung by a lurking Scorpion, he ſaid: From this time forward I will never run ſo head-long on my net; this ſting ſhall teach me wiſedome hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:10478:142"/>
Thus muſt we reaſon with our ſelves. And, when the wound of our calamity being healed, we finde we have offended by impatience, let us turn ſtraight to our ſelves, and ſay: See, thou mad outragious Bull, how thou haſt behaved thy ſelfe in this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how diſdainfully and impatiently, with ſuch fury as if thou wouldſt have torn the Moon from her ſpheare. Is this thy Chriſtian patience? Aſpireſt thou to heaven by this means? Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou every little prick of a needle? every flea-biting? See thou ſhew thy ſelfe another manner of man hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be mindfull of patience.</p>

Conſider, ah! conſider, whatſoever thou ſuffereſt now, is but the flight pricking of a pin: whatſoever torments thee now, is but a trifle. But who of us is able to inhabite with devouring fire, with ardours everlaſting?</p>
                     <p>Sometimes we are of this opinion, and ſtick not to ſay: I can no longer endure this fellow, I have endured him as long as poſſibly I can; what man can brook him any longer? And how (O man!) wilt thou brooke the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Divels and damned ghoſts, with all the torments they endure, which are farre greater then can be imagined? If God puniſh ſo ſeverly in a place of pardon and mercy, how will he chaſtiſe where there is no hope of mercy? Whenſoever therefore thou burneſt, or art ſick, think &amp; ſay to thy ſelfe: Behold a paterne of hell, but a painted one! See a little taſte of hell, but the mildeſt that may be! It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner of fire which buries and burnes the wicked there, then that thou ſuffereſt; this is ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in compariſon of that eternall.

                     <p>But as God, in the Schoole of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, offers us a taſte of helliſh teares, ſo gives he us ſome relliſh here, before hand, of eternall joyes in heaven.

What then is our next refuge? To thee, O my God! to thee from the very bottome of my heart do I ſigh: thy houſe is wide, ſpacious, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſecure.

                     <p>Contrariwiſe in this vale of teares, there is nothing but tediouſnes, griefs upon griefes without intermiſſion, all the world repleniſhed with ſorrow and mourning. Diſſolve then, O Lord! (if this my requeſt may be lawfull) and ruinate this cottage of my body: I reckon not what becomes of it, ſo I may take my flight to thee. I have lamented my fill upon the bankes of Babylon; my harp long ſince is hung upon the willow boughes, and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; onely the celeſtiall Sion is my hearts delight: To thee alone, my God, to thee my reſtleſſe thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire.

God, ſaid he, made the world, not only great and admirable, but likewiſe fraile and corruptible. What he wrought by the Apoſtles, the ſame he did in the whole world. And what effected he by them? Mary, ſhewed many ſignes, wrought great and wonderfull miracles, yet permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to be continually ſcourged, driven from place to place, caſt into priſon, afflicted with corporall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſtoned, crucified, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vexed with tribulations: Leaſt perhaps they ſhould be taken rather for Gods then men, doing ſo many miracles and wonders above the power of man.

Certainly it is much to be wondered at, there being in Hieruſalem ſo many clear, chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and ſweet flowing waters, why Almighty God, in this muddy, foul and troubled pond, polluted with the butchery of ſo many beaſts, hair and bloud of ſo many ſlaughters, would place the benefit of health. Had it not been a more illuſtrious miracle to have cured in the river of Jordan, or in ſweet roſe water, then in this foul and noiſome pond? Ah! Chriſtians, how far different are the judgements of God, from thoſe of men? God was pleaſed to waſh the ſoul, not in the waters of Jericho, or Damaſcus, not in water ſweetned with nard or roſes, but in the waters which he himſelf hath moved and ſtirred with his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:10478:155"/>
Croſſe, in the ſalt ſea of miſeries, the vaſt ocean of calamities. This is our waſhing place, theſe our bathes, thus we are cleanſed. God in times paſt, to expiate thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, preſcribed to the Jews, waters mingled either with aſhes, or bloud: no river is ſo ſoveraigne for the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and purifying of the ſoul of man: fountains of bloud ſpring unto us out of the wounds of Chriſt crucified; our daily ſins miniſter to us a ſharp lie: to theſe fountains therefore we have our recourſe, here we expiate and waſh away our filth and corruption, here we riſe again and recover ſtrength. But as yet I will not depart from this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick pool of Hieruſalem.</p>
                     <p>When therefore our Saviour ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into one of the portalls, whereof we have ſpoken, he found a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſick perſons, but of all theſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but onely one. Some will ſay, How ſparing was our Lord of his benefits? Seeing he might have healed them all with the leaſt word of his mouth: Why then, I beſeech you, did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore but one of them to his health? Perhaps he would do according to the uſe of the pool, which never healed but
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:10478:156"/>
one at a time. But we ask this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Why God being infinitely mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and potent, who pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow this vertue of healing upon that pond, would not cure all thoſe ſick and ſore perſons? For as the Sun eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day with his cheerfull rayes, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to innumerable creatures, without any hurt or dammage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo the Creatour of the Sun ſhould ſuffer no loſſe, by beſtowing health and happineſſe upon many ſick and miſerable men at once. My anſwer is, that the Sun with his pleaſant beams fails not to illuminate and ſweetly comfort all creatures, but when the clouds interpoſe themſelves. No cloud ſo thick and gloomy, as that of ſin, by which the Sun of mercy is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed over and excluded. Hieremie, bewailing this evill, ſaid: Thou haſt oppoſed a cloud againſt thy ſelf, ſo that thy prayer can have no paſſage. The multitude of our ſins often times is the cauſe that we cannot altogether acquit our ſelves of all our miſeries and afflictions. The reaſon why Chriſt cured but one at this water in Hieruſalem, was, perhaps, becauſe he ſaw none of the reſt worthy of that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:10478:156"/>
benefit. But admit they were all free from ſin, and of upright courſe of life, why ſhould then but one be reſtored to his health? We anſwer again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That ſo it was expedient for them; it was good for them thus to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. All things are not convenient for all perſons. Many thouſands of men are ſick, and by that means make towards heaven, who if they were in health, and lived commodiouſly, would take the ready way to hell.</p>
                     <p>A moſt true ſaying it is, <hi>Quae no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, docent.</hi> It is good for me and thee, O Chriſtian! yea and for innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable more that God doth humble us. It is well knowne to the ſchoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter himſelfe, what is moſt expedient for each of his ſcholars. How oft hath extream calamity been the beginning of ſalvation? how oft hath loſſe been the occaſion of greateſt gaine? And therefore oftentimes we may ſay with Themiſtocles: we had periſhed, if we had not been undone.</p>
                     <p>We account the ſilk worms happy, for that they have a ſilken houſe, and a labour ſo neer to reſt. But if we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſider the matter, we ſhall finde their houſe, as we call it, to be their

Nay more, take this for a certain rule, that when the appetite ſo hotly purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing (which tendeth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards God) it is no other then a foul ſin covered under a fair pretext. And therefore Chriſt for the moſt part gives us with a bountifull hand, thoſe things which are moſt profitable for us; inviting all freely to the School of Patience, but not ſo to the glory of this world: If any one (ſaith he) will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe and follow me; not to a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant garden, but to the horrid and noiſome mount Calvary.</p>

this, expect not temporall benefits which were given him with increaſe, but rather hope for eternall, ſuch as our Lord received.

                     <p>AND leſt any man ſhould repine againſt this chaſtizing hand of God, Saint Auguſtine ſaith: That which thou ſuffereſt, for which thou lamenteſt, is no puniſhment but a medicine, not for thy condemnation, but reformation. Refuſe not ſtripes, unleſſe thou ſetteſt light by thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; thinke rather what place thou haſt in thy fathers teſtament, then how much his ſcourges paine thee; whom God loveth he chaſtizeth; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very child he receiveth, he ſcourgeth. He receives them after chaſtizement, yet thou ſayeſt he repells and rejects them; we may ſee like practiſe of parents, who now and then leave their grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe children to take their owne cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:10478:164"/>
thoſe of whom they have ſome hope, they ſcourge and correct; but whom they ſee altogether paſt hope and correction, they caſt off to live at their owne liberty. Now what ſonne ſoever the father permits to take his pleaſure, he purpoſeth to diſinherit, but the heire and hope of his houſe he chaſtizeth and puniſheth. Let not therefore ſuch a ſonne ſhew himſelfe ſo vaine and childiſh, as to ſay: my father loves my brother better, whom he hath left at his owne liberty: I can no ſooner trangreſſe his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but I am puniſhed. Rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in afflictions, becauſe for thee he reſerves the inheritance; our Lord will never reject them whom he hath choſen for himſelfe: well may he for a time chaſtiſe them, but he will never damne them eternally. Chooſe which thou wilt: a temporall chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or everlaſting torment: tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall felicity, or to live and raigne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; what is that which God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens? Everlaſting puniſhment: what doth hee promiſe? Everlaſting reſt and happineſſe. The puniſhment which God inflicts on good men is temporall: the ſcope and liberty hee
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:10478:164"/>
gives to evill men is temporall: if God therefore ſcourge evevery child he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth, without doubt, he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth him whom hee ſcourgeth not. If thou refuſe to be ſcourged, why de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt thou to be received? He ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth every ſonne, who ſpared not ſo much as his only begotten ſonne. Be contented therefore to bee under the hand of thy Father, and if thou beeſt a good ſonne, refuſe not a fathers diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: for whom canſt thou properly call a ſon, to whom the father gives not diſcipline? Let him not ſpare to puniſh thee, ſo hee take not from thee his mercy, let him chaſtiſe thy way ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo he deprive thee not of thine inheritance. If thou well remember thy fathers promiſes, feare rather to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited then puniſhed; ſhall a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſonne ſcorne the whip, ſeeing Gods only ſonne ſcourged, who never did, nor could commit a ſinne? Every one therefore muſt of neceſſity bee ſcourged for his ſinnes, from whom notwithſtanding, if he be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, the mercy of God is not eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Aſſuredly if thou once become ſo hardned in iniquity, that thou ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt the rod and hand of him who
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:10478:165"/>
ſhould correct thee, if thou ſcorn the diſcipline of God, and withdraw thy ſelf from his fatherly chaſtiſement, if thou wilt not endure his ſtripes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he puniſheth thy ſins, it is not he that rejecteth thee, but thou thy ſelf abandoneſt thine inheritance: for hadſt thou willingly ſuffered thy ſelf to be ſcourged, thou hadſt not been diſinherited. My mercy (ſaith he) I will not take from him, neither hurt him in my truth. For from him the mercy of the deliverer ſhall not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, that the truth of the puniſher may not hurt him.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, my Chriſtian brother, both opportunely and importune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ought to be often inculcated: Trouble not thy ſelf for whatſoever miſeries or perplexities thou falleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, be not dejected in minde, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented or apt to murmure; let St. Auguſtine admoniſh thee: that the ſcourge is a ſoveraigne receit and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine againſt ſin; the ſcourge of God teacheth good men patience Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is but for a time; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns not for ever.

                     <p>WHen Chriſt was to enter into his faſt of forty dayes, he was led by his Spirit, that he might be tempted: So ſaith Saint Matthew; Then Jeſus was led into the deſert by his Spirit, that he might be tempted by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. It was the Spirit of God that led Chriſt to all things; to prayer, to pious diſcourſes, to Sermons, to work miracles; but here it is particularly ſaid: He was led by the ſame Spirit to be tempted. What elſe do the holy Scriptures affirm in this place; but that even the deareſt friends of God, are led with a vail as it were before their eyes to the Croſſe. We are led, I ſay, for the moſt part blindfold, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:10478:169"/>
like mad furious bulls, we would hardly be drawn to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Behold therefore the Son of God led into the liſts, there to be aſſaulted. Why then do we ſo frequently and profanely uſe theſe ſpeeches? This man came of the Devills errand: The Devill hath done me this diſpleaſure: This thunderbolt comes from Satan. Fools that we are, we deceive our ſelves; theſe are fond and impious ſpeeches; better it were to ſay thus; This came from our Lord: It was our Lords pleaſure: It lighted upon us from his hand; for it is our Lord that doth all this.</p>
                     <p>And when Gedeon threſhed his corn, the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and ſaid: The Lord be with thee, O moſt valiant of men! And Gedeon ſaid to him: I beſeech thee, my Lord, if the Lord be with us, Why have theſe evills fallen upon us? Where are his marvellous works, which our fathers have told us? But now our Lord hath forſaken us. For at the ſelf ſame time the Iſraelites were afflicted by the Madianites. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how abſurdly and ridiculouſly humane ignorance diſcourſeth: If the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:10478:169"/>
Lord be with us, how comes it to paſſe that matters go ſo ill with us? As if, forſooth, theſe calamities were not from the hand of God, as the beſt and happieſt ſucceſſe. Therefore the Angel ſaid; Go armed with that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour thou haſt, and thou ſhalt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Iſrael out of the hands of the Madianites. As if he ſhould have ſaid: Know that God (albeit he hath ſent enemies to invade his people) hath not utterly abandoned them. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the pleaſure of God to make proof and triall of your love towards him.</p>
                     <p>So God viſits us with diſeaſes, and a thouſand incommodities, to ſtir up and eſtabliſh our confidence in him, and the better to make us know our ſelves. Yet as we may reſiſt an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſo may we by lawfull remedies ſeek to cure our diſeaſes, ſeeing we know not the determinate will of God, how long we muſt continue in them. What ſhould hinder a priſoner from going out when he ſees the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon door open? This is not to break priſon, but to make his benefit of an occaſion offered.</p>
                     <p>And as one jalour eaſily keeps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a hundred or two hundred priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:10478:170"/>
ſo they be in chaines and fetters; none of them (albeit they have wings of Dedalus) are able to eſcape; but if any of them file aſunder his fetters, open the priſon door and break away, then not one man alone, but a whole band of officers muſt purſue him, to ſee if happily they may apprehend him againe. The like altogether is to be obſerved in this affaire: they queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe whom the divell perſecutes, tempts, vexes and afflicts, are none of his priſoners: he is bound and lies captive who is fettered with the gives of luxury, pride, envy and avarice. Thoſe the divell needs never to hunt after, they are his owne in ſure cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But ſo ſoone as any of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to break priſon and get away, they ſhall finde ſatan, and all the force of hell oppoſe them, many wicked and malitious men will purſue and perſecute them; who therefore can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe this to their ill fortune, that they have many perſecutours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enemies, ſeeing it is moſt certaine that all that deſire to live piouſly in Jeſus Chriſt, muſt of neceſſity ſuffer perſecution.</p>

                     <p>Let us, I pray you, looke for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or better intreatie in the Schoole of Patience: we muſt not thinke here to ſit ſtill and take our eaſe: and as in thoſe Schooles I ſpoke of before, of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, fencing, and art military, the maſters themſelves entertaine their ſcholars with blows and wounds: ſo in the Schoole of Patience, all paine and anguiſh, all evill and puniſhment, is from God himſelfe the rectour thereof; Prepare therefore thy ſoule for temptation. From God proceede not only mild, cheerfull, faire and fortunate, but likewiſe the unlucky, darke, duskiſh and diſmall dayes; which Eccleſiaſtes plainly affirming,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:10478:171"/>
ſaith: for as God hath made the one ſo alſo he hath the other, that a man may find no juſt cauſe of complaints againſt him. It was purpoſely the will of God to ſet a foule day againſt a faire, adverſity againſt proſperity, and to temper and qualifie the force and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the one with the mixture of the other, that it might be more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and medicinable to mens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and diſeaſes; wherefore be mindfull of adverſity in proſperity, and of proſperity in adverſity; Thinke of poverty in time of plenty, and in the middeſt of thy riches, of the poore mans neceſſity<hi>:</hi> from morning unto evening, time ſhall be changed, and all theſe are ſowne in the eies of God.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore moſt attentively conſider, that all adverſity is ſent us from God, that moſt juſt and ſupreme Judge. Let us not impute the cauſe of our miſeries to that which is not, for they neither come from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the deſert mountaines; becauſe God is judge. He humbleth this man, and that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth, becauſe there is a cup in the hand of the Lord of meer wine full of mixture. And he hath powred it out
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:10478:172"/>
of this into that, but yet the dregges thereof are not emptied: all the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth ſhall drinke.</p>
                     <p>Behold, O you Chriſtians! and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave deeply in your hearts theſe docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This man God comforts, that he afflicts; The cup of all miſeries and afflictions is in his hand; this cup of the Lord is full of pure wine as it comes from the grape, but withall it hath its mixture; for not one ſort but divers kinds of wine are powred into this cup. Excellent wine when it is mingled, not with water, but with wine more excellent then it ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes infinitly ſtrong. So the revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full juſtice of God aboundeth with multiplicity and variety of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as with ſeverall kinds of wines. Many men have ſuffered both great and manifold miſeries: to theſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pure wine is given, but mingled, as I ſaid before. Let them be of good courage; all this notwithſtanding is gentle and tollerable. For by this meanes God inclines, ſometimes to this man, ſometimes to that, one while he offers his cup to John, another while to Peter, and ſometimes to James: this honourable Cup paſſeth to all: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:10478:172"/>
one muſt taſte thereof more or leſſe, as it hath ſeemed good to our Lord from all eternity; this ſpeech is uſed to every one: either drinke or get thee gone.</p>
                     <p>But this may be a great comfort, that no man (eſpecially in this world) is compelled to drink up the dregs: The dregs thereof are not emptied. The greateſt puniſhments and revenges of juſtice, are reſerved till the laſt day of judgement: Then all the ſinners of the earth ſhall drink. Whatſoever tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation we ſuffer now, is but momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and light; it may ſeem but a ſport and jeſt in compariſon of the bitter dregs which the fury and indignation of God ſhall give eternally to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to drink and never drink up. Let us now, O Chriſtians! joyfully drink up theſe cups, though ſomewhat bitter; ſeeing we are excuſed from drinking up the dregs. The cup which moſt of us ſo much feare, is filled with our Lords wine, he it is that offers it; the cup we refuſe is in the hand of our Lord; God is the authour of all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and calamity.</p>

And, I pray you, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> God the author of all this? He is, good ſir, the author of all this: not that God commanded him to lye or calumniate: God (ſaith Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus) hath commanded no man to do impiouſly, and he hath given no man time to ſin. But I urge further: What if I ſhould ſay, that God commanded him to do theſe injuries, ſhould I ſay amiſſe? That moſt holy King David ſayes even as much: for when the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Shimier reproached him with words, nay, even caſt ſtones at him, and ſome of the Kings train were of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:10478:173"/>
mind to have cut off his head: the King gave expreſſe charge to all his followers in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>his manner: Let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that he may curſe: for our Lord hath commanded him to curſe David: and who is he that dare ſay, Why hath he ſo done? Did therfore Shimei commit no ſin in doing this? yea doubtleſſe a moſt heynous one: ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a while, and the truth will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare.</p>
                     <p>When David, the wiſeſt of Kings, ſaw this wretch Shimei all alone, and unarmed, and yet heard him calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate him reſolutely, and without feare, he preſently was of opinion, that the firſt beginning or fundamentall cauſe of that injury, proceeded, not from Shemei, but from God, who had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſlanderous and malicious ſpeech of ſo wicked a man, to chaſtiſe and puniſh him. By what means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did God command him this?</p>
                     <p>Be adviſed and underſtand the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it is. There are two things to be conſidered in ſin: The firſt is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motion of the body, or will, or of them both jointly together: the other is the tranſgreſſion it ſelfe of the law. For example: One brother ſlanders
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:10478:174"/>
another, a citizen kills a citizen, a ſouldier ſets an houſe of fire, a thiefe ſteals a thouſand crownes. In theſe acts the motion of the tongue, the deadly ſtroke, the ſetting fire to the houſe, the taking away of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, are done by Gods help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: for they are all naturall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which cannot be done without Gods help. And this is the firſt thing which ought to be conſidered in every ſin, which without doubt is by this meanes furthered by God himſelfe. But the other is the very nature it ſelfe of ſin, as when this naturall action is imployed contrary to reaſon, againſt conſcience and the law of God; this God neither willeth nor commandeth: nevertheleſſe, he directeth the perverſe will of this man, or that ſin and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of his lawes, to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, admonition, correction, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the patience of another man. Therefore of doing the thing God is the authour; and when it is ill done, he is a provident director.</p>
                     <p>So God aſſiſted Shimei to utter his words, to caſt durt and ſtones (for theſe were no other then naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) but for ſo much as Shimei
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:10478:174"/>
ſhewed a malicious will againſt his Prince, thereunto God concurred not: but nevertheleſſe, directed it to a very good end, that by theſe calumnies the ſins of David might be puniſhed, his patience and humility exerciſed.</p>
                     <p>And this may be ſeen and obſerued in all ſins, and in all injuries whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: The evill of ſin God tolerates, and the evill of puniſhment he orders and directs to a good end; to increaſe patience, and to puniſh ſin. Thus he permits famine, war, plagues, deluges, burning, thefts, injuries, injuſtices and enormous crimes; and withall, ſo diſpoſeth them, that even by theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills he manifeſteth to the world more and more his goodneſſe, his juſtice, his power, and his glory. After this manner God is the Authour of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as they are puniſhments: of which Doctrine we produce truth it ſelf for a witneſſe.</p>
                     <p>God being highly offended with the Jews, ſaid: I will gather evills up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and glut my arrows with them. Lo, I will bring upon them evills, out of which they ſhall not be able to eſcape. Behold, God even loads with evills, God wounds us
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:10478:175"/>
with his arrows. And we childiſhly are angry with his arrows and darts; we never mark what arm it is that ſhoots and darts them: So the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when his picture is not to his minde, quarrels with his pencill; the Serivener with his pen; the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with his ax; the Potter with his clay; ſo we accuſe thoſe that malice and ſlander us as authours of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills: but we are infinitely deceived, it is not the pencill, but the Painter; the pen, but the Scrivener, who are the authours of the writing or picture. Job was, in this reſpect, of a better opinion, when he ſaid; The hand of our Lord had touched him: It was neither the Caldeans, nor the Sabeans, nor any other enemy whatſoever, but the hand of God that hath overthrown me.</p>

                     <p>HAve we any doubt of this? It is the teſtimony of the wiſe man: Good things and evill, life and death, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honeſty come from God. This the Prophet Micheas clearly confirms, where he ſaith: That evill is deſcended from the Lord into the gate of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:10478:175"/>
And that he might make them more cautelous whom he admoniſhed: Behold (quoth he) I purpoſe evill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this family. The like affirmeth the Prophet Amos: And where finally ſhall there be evill which our Lord hath not done? And that we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly acknowledge all theſe evills of puniſhment, and innumerable kindes of affliction, to come from the Divine will of God; let us call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, he woften he hath by little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible creatures, diſcomfited his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, in far more glorious manner, then he could with great &amp; puiſſant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Thus Almighty God is wont to ſuppreſſe humane pride, thus he ſends poor abject worms, mice, bats, flies, lice, and ſuch like ſordid creatures, to vanquiſh, not the ſcum, or dregs of the people, but to triumph over Kings, Princes, Emperours. Thus he draws forth, as it were, whole armies of gnats, flies, frogs, waſps and locuſts; and with theſe troops overthrows whole nations and countreys.</p>

The like doth the maſter in a School, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whips a ſhrewd boy himſelfe, or delivers him over to another to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. Why may not God do the ſame? Why may not he at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure either ſcourge us with his owne hand, or by anothers?

Minde not that, but the intention of him that commands it. Thy father himſelfe is preſent, who appoints it, and will not ſuffer thee to receive ſo much as one ſtripe more then he hath ordained.</p>
                     <p>After this manner a Magiſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a guilty perſon to be put to death: the executioner perhaps hates this man beyond meaſure, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pull him in pieces with burning pincers, then take his life at one blow. But ſeeing Magiſtrates commands muſt be executed, he takes no leſſe pleaſure in cutting off his head. What hurt (I pray) had this man by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners hatred? No more then if he had entirely loved him. He took
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:10478:181"/>
his head off as the Magiſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and further it was not in his power to touch him. Even thus our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, how extreamly ſoever they hate us, can no further annoy us, then God freely permits them. Moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in this point Saint Auguſtine encourageth us. Feare not, quoth he, thine enemy, his act goes no further then he is permitted by the power he hath received. Feare him who doth all as he will himſelf, and yet doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unjuſtly: for every act of his is juſt and reaſonable.</p>
                     <p>Let ſinners rage all that they will, and as much as is permitted them: our Lord confirmes and ſtrengthens the juſt. Whatſoever befalls a juſt man, (note this, I beſeech you, note it moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What then hath the wicked man to boaſt of, but that our Father hath made him my ſcourge? he entertaines him indeed, as his ſlave and hireling, but me he breeds up to inherit his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. Neither ought we ſo much to obſerve what liberty he gives to the unjuſt, as what rewards he reſerves for
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:10478:182"/>
the juſt. God deales with us in this, as men do: They ſometimes in their anger catch up whatſoever ſwitch or rod comes firſt to their hands, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with bear their childe; but this rod af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they throw into the fire, and reſerve their childe for the inheritance.</p>
                     <p>So God exerciſeth us by evill men, and inſtructs us by their perſecution. By the malice of the evill man the good man is ſcourged; &amp; by the ſervant the ſonne is reformed.

the diſquiet of our minds.

Why therefore do we accuſe our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and thoſe that maligne us, as if they were the cauſe of all our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?

But what marvell if there be in our minde ſo little quietneſſe, ſeeing there is in it ſo little temper of our tongue, or patience?

It went hard with Mardocheus to have this exacted of him, which according to the Religion he profeſſed, he could not with a good conſcience perform: Whether it were that Aman had the pictures and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the gods upon his garments, (as ſome men think) or that this ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration were to be exhibited to him as to a god, it is not certainly known; ſure it is, this adoration ſeemed not due to a man: Mardocheus therefore ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appealing to God, ſaid: Lord, Lord, King omnipotent, for in thy domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are all things, and there is none that can reſiſt thy will, if thou deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to ſave Iſrael.

                     <p>By this example we are inſtructed to comply, even with the moſt wicked, in all manner of courteſy, benevolence and obſervance, to exhibit unto them unfainedly all obedience and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and by this meanes not only to honour them all that we may, but likewiſe to be ready to fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them and kiſſe their feet; we muſt reforme ſuch like odious ſpeeches and cogitations: this is my enemy, a man full of ſpleen and rancour, a detractour, an envious perſon, I cannot chooſe but hate him, he is not worthy to be ſeene, or ſomuch as thought off, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in him but wickedneſſe, and miſchiefe; I will have nothing to do with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

what juſt cauſe, I pray, have you heere to complaine? If you be wiſe you will rather ſay: I am ready with all my heart to kiſſe the very ground where he treads. And this the more readily, for that God can with much facility cauſe an alteration, and appoint Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docheus uſher over Aman, ſo that he may ſay with good authority: recite A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, recite.</p>
                     <p>Conſider theſe wondrous changes. Aman a neere favorite of the kings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in wealth, boaſting his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous family, his multitude of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the proſperity of fortune, the kings eſpeciall favours, and the eſteem even of a God upon earth. This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I ſay, is by the king ſuddenly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be hanged on a gibbet, while Mardocheus, a little before condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſame death, was in all haſte cloathed in princely garments, ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a horſe ſutable to that ſtate, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and led through the principall ſtreet, Aman going before him in the condition of a ſervant, and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: this is the honour given to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man whom the king is pleaſed to dignifie. O my God! what a ſuddaine and prodigious change is this? this is
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:10478:187"/>
the uſuall manner of God: for it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the eies of God ſuddainly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the poore man. Mardocheus now ready to put his necke into the halter, is exalted to a throne: and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was ſo neare a throne, is advanced to a gibbet. Wretched A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man take poſſeſſion of that ſtructure which thou frameſt for thy adverſary, climbe up and adorne that gallowes which thou dideſt efect for thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Behold how ſeverely God is wont to puniſh thoſe who are not content to carry a croſſe themſelves, but would crucifie their enemies. So ſuddain an alteration there is of fortune; the ſword and halter is drawne from the necke of Mardocheus, and he allotted to our live Aman his perſecutour.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore love our croſſe, and not refuſe to beare it, whoſoever he be that laies it upon us. Let us be of good courage; it is no matter whether the maſter or the ſervant afflict us; but we muſt chiefly conſider who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or permits it. It is hard indeed to be mortified by them from whom thou doſt leaſt expect it. But even the holieſt men have often endured this kind of miſerie.</p>

Job and Tobias were laughed to ſcorne by their owne wives and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks; they returned not ſcoffe for ſcoffe, nor taunt for taunt.

mindful what Job ſaid: The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, as it hath pleaſed our Lord, ſo it is done: bleſſed be the Name of our Lord. They were unjuſt men who ſat about Job, lying all putrified with ſcres and ulcers: and he (who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was to be received) was ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, while they were ſpared for future puniſhment.

The good men live in labour and travell, becauſe they are ſcourged as children: the evill exult and are ſuffered to live at their own pleaſure, becauſe they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as ſtrangers. The enemy is outragious indeed, but it nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails him. What is it then afflicts thee? Well may he exerciſe thee, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt thee. Nay, his cutrage will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profit thee, and his cruelty crown thee with victory; which ſurely ſhould be none at all, hadſt thou no adverſary.

Let us therefore perſevere patiently: the more pain and puniſhment now; the more reward and glory ſhall we have in time to come.</p>

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:10478:189"/>
quality we muſt not look for of the cart, mill or plough horſe. King Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander of Macedon had a horſe called Bucephalus, bought for 7080. crowns.

know not how to ſuffer it? This we will ſet down in order, but as ſuccinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as may be.

                     <p>IT is an excellent ſaying of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients: A good man never careth what, but how well he ſuffers: many trophees have been erected by force, but more by patience. Chriſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of the moſt happy liberty that may be, ſaith: In your patience you ſhall poſſeſſe your ſouls. So far is an impatient man from poſſeſſing himſelf, and that which is his, that he even overthrows himſelf, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in his charge: he is not the maſter of himſelf, but a ſlave to vices. Hereupon Bildad asketh Job: Why deſtroyeſt thou thy ſoul in thy fury? The impatient man gives way &amp; free rains to his own paſſions, and thereby thruſts, as it were, out of the windows,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:10478:190"/>
the freedome of reaſon, and ſuſtaines loſſe in many things. But the patient man preſerves both himſelfe and all he hath, and is more valiant then the valianteſt; which Salomon confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſaith: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tter is the patient then a ſtrong man: and he that ruleth his minde, then the overthrower of cities. For a patient man ſetteth a ſure guard, not only over his mouth &amp; hand, but even over his cogitations. By patience anger is ſuppreſſed, the will curbd, the ſuddaine raſhneſſe of the hands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and the poyſon of the tongue aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid of a pratler, This man cannot rule his tongue, the ſame may be verified of an impatient man; He hath no government in his anger. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and wrath tranſport and drive him headlong whither they liſt; he hath whole hoaſts of rancorous thoughts, all led by impatience. No man ſhall ever have perfect dominion over his paſſions, but by patience. In your patience you ſhall poſſeſſe your ſouls: not in your policie or prudence; not in your fortune, wealth, or riches, but in your patience you ſhall poſſeſſe your ſoules.</p>

                        <pb n="365" facs="tcp:10478:190"/>
But know you not the definition of patience? this it is: Patience is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſuffering without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint for what things ſoever happen or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>O you Chriſtians! it is not the huge weight of your croſſe, but the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of you that beare it, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth impatience. He that builds a houſe, when he covers it, doth it not with intent to keep the roofe-free from rain, haile, or ſnow, but that it may without damage endure, and beare out haile, ſnow, and rain. He that builds a ſhip, ſeeks not to ſecure it from waves and ſtormes, but to prevent all chinkes, and make it tite againſt lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. He that fears the ſharpneſſe of the weather in reſpect of his health, goes not about to hinder or withſtand the nipping northern winds, or hinder them from blowing upon him, but keeps

For our greateſt care is to keep our ſelves from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, poverty, and contempt, whereas we ſhould be moſt carefull to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in ſickneſſe, poverty and contempt.

We need uſe no Art to avoid miſeries, but the beſt uſe of Art is in ſuffering them patiently. Wherein I am of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons opinion.</p>
                     <p>This Philoſopher, as Laertius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, was wont to ſay: That it was a great, yea even the greateſt miſery of all, not to be able to endure miſery. To whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:10478:191"/>
knowes not how to live. No man takes contentment in this life, but he that hath learned to beare the miſeries therof. For example: The ſtone and gout are ſaid to be the greateſt and the moſt intollerable torments in the world, paines which even make men mad: yet there have been eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have patiently borne theſe paines how great ſoever.</p>
                     <p>Carneades came to viſit Ageſilaus when he lay grievouſly ſicke of the gout; and fearing leſt he might by diſcourſing exaſperate him, ſpake as compendiouſly as he could, and took his leave. But Ageſilaus ſaid unto him: Stay, I pray you Carneades, and withall pointed with his finger firſt to his feet, and then to his breaſt: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (quoth he) from theſe parts comes hither. By which ſpeech he made known that his heart was ſound, merry, and able to endure paine, though his feet were, as he ſaw, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably ſwolne, and afflicted with the gout.</p>
                     <p>A Prince of the Empire viſited Charles the fifth, Emperour of famous memory, and finding him much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the gout, uſed ſuch words

Let every one of us freely ſay the like to all thoſe whom he takes for his enemies. If God hath given you power, go on, beat me, teare me with your teeth, heape all the injuries you can upon me, in vaine were it for me to reſiſt you: but if you have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, gape you never ſo much, whet your teeth never ſo much, you ſhall not bite, nor ſo much as touch me.</p>
                     <p>That moſt bleſſed Biſhop, Gregory the great, did not only write ſingular documents of Patience, but alſo by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:10478:196"/>
confirmed his doctrine: both taught and practiſed it. For to Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius the Emperour, by whom he was diverſly injured, he returned this anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in writing: for ſo much as daily I offend my God, I verily hope that theſe inceſſant afflictions which I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuffer, will ſtand another day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene me and his terrible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and I beleeve, moſt excellent Prince, you goe as fat beyond me in pleaſing that great Lord, as you are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous in correcting me, who am ſo ill a ſervant of his</p>
                     <p>O my God! What patience, what a ſubmiſſion was this? He ſaid moſt truly indeed: Patience is a remedy for all griefs. What Saint was ever crowned without Patience?</p>
                     <p>It is a ſaying amongſt Grammarians, There is no generall rule without ſome exception; yet this rule of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is without exception. Therefore St. Paul preſcribed it ſo ſtrictly: Be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, quoth he, to all, with all humility &amp; patience. Patience is to be exerciſed without exception, in all things, in all places, at all times, and to all kinde of perſons: for without patience there can be no perfect vertue. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:10478:196"/>
impatience is the mother of all vice; from whence, as it were from a fountain, are derived many ſtreams of hainous ſins and offences. The impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient man never condeſcendeth unto any, the patient never reſiſteth or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth. The naturall properties of impatience may be found in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill himſelf. Impatience is the parent of abſurd and ſottiſh madneſſe. For what can be more fooliſh, what a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſigne of madneſſe, then for a man willingly to double his owne evill, and reject the reward promiſed to him that is Patient?</p>
                     <p>An impatient man, for the loſſe of a farthing, throwes a whole purſe of money away: take but one care of corne from him and he will fire the whole ſheafe. Such a one lived in the court of the Emperour Rodolphus the ſecond: a noble man of his privy chamber, who bringing a chryſtall glaſſe full of water, in the morning, to waſh the Emperours face, by chance let fall the cover unawares, and with it daſhed the whole glaſſe it ſelfe againſt the ground, ſaying: let the divell take the horſe too, ſince he hath the ſaddle; thus hee caſt away fowre hundred
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:10478:197"/>
crownes at one blow, for at ſo much the chryſtall glaſſe was valued. Thus a light loſſe is many times doubled with a far greater: thus ſmall incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences are through impatience aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It is the ſaying of Salomon. He that is impatient ſhall ſuſtain damage. The more repugnance a man hath in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the more grievouſly he feeles that which he ſuffers; like wild beaſts, which, whileſt they ſtrive and ſtruggle, pull the ſnare the cloſer; like poore birds, more entangled with lime-twiggs, whileſt for feare they flutter and ſeeke to get out. There is no yoke ſo ſtrait, but hurts him leſſe that is willingly led, then it doth another who ſtrives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Therefore a wiſe man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be patient in all things; a foole knowes neither how to doe, nor ſuffer; very well ſaith Salomon: he that is patient is governed with much w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſaid Nicetas Chroniates: what may not alacrity do, and a good heart in a croſſe and diſaſtrous buſineſſe?</p>
                     <p>Behold Chriſt our Lord! who when joy was propoſed, ſuſtained the croſſe, contemning confuſion. Our Saviour obtained a double reward both for himſelfe and us: for himſelfe, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his humane body, and dominion over the world: for us, grace and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation both of ſoul and body; with this reward, as a joy propoſed, he ſo qualified and tempered all his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that being to undergoe a moſt bitter and ignominious death, he made ſhew of admirable joy and exultation. Therefore contemning all confuſion, he ſaid, with a deſire have I deſired to eate this paſche with you before I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Alas a bloudy paſchel yet he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it: and, as if he had gone to a moſt delicious banquet, haſtned joyfully &amp; cheerfully to Jeruſalem; like a giant he exulted to run his race; What race I beſeech you? ſurely, from Pilates houſe to Golgotha; and therefore being on his way forbad all weeping.</p>
                     <p>For being in very deed to ſuffer a moſt cruell death, he offered himſelfe, not only as a ſacrifice, with a free and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:10478:202"/>
liberall heart, with a cheerfull and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene countenance; but even from the firſt moment that he took fleſh in the womb of his mother, he had moſt clearly preſent before his eyes, the croſſe, and all the paſſages of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note place="margin">Note this well.</note> Thus Chriſt, during the whole time he continued in humane fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held ſtill, as it were with his eyes, his ſtripes at the pillar, and his nailing on the croſſe. So that I may well ſay, Chriſt was tormented upon the Croſſe not onely three houres, but even three and thirty yeares and more; and yet, having joy propoſed, he endured all this pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt himſelfe ſaith: Bleſſed are you when men ſhall ſpeak evill of you, and perſecute you, accuſing you falſly for my ſake: rejoyce and exult, becauſe your reward is great in heaven.

ſpake with great confidence to God in this manner: This (quoth he) O Lord! is that which troubles ſome ſo much, and therefore they ſay thou haſt ſo few friends in the world, becauſe thou handleſt them ſo roughly, and hence it comes that ſo many fall from thee. What anſwer makeſt thou to this, my Lord? But in very deed, that man well experienced in divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, knew calamities to be benefites of ſo high a price, and worthy of ſo cheerfull an acceptance, that he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to ſay: That one hundred yeares of prayer to God daily upon our knees, would not be ſufficient worthily to beg ſo much as one onely croſſe. Why then ſhould we not rejoyce, when God vonchſafes this favour by father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaſtiſement? How joyfull was S. Paul when he uttered theſe words? I am repleniſhed with conſolation, I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation. And if I be immola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the ſacrifice of your faith, I rejoyce and congratulate you all, and do you rejoyce for the ſame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate me.

                     <p>ZAchary propheſying of theſe men, ſaid, They ſhall be as the valiant Champions of Ephtaim, and their heart ſhall be made cheerfull with wine. So Joſue, of the tribe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, out of hope of gaining the land of Promiſe, a moſt pleaſant and fruitfull countrey, boldly expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to all perils and dangers. Whence (I pray you) proceeds this ſtrength, this courage of minde? Their heart ſhall be cheered up, as it were, with wine. Wine, the ſymbole of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall felicity, makes them ſo couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt all adverſity. For they ſhall be inebriated with the plenty of thy houſe. Now we rejoyce, but as it

This cauſed the Chriſtian Martyrs to be ſo reſolute and fearleſſe, inſomuch as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven laughing for joy, they advanced to croſſes, wheels, fires and gibbets; their hearts were cheered with this wine, Saint Auguſtine ſaith of them: Doing and ſuffering ſuch things, they were moſt infinitely glad and joyfull.

                     <p>Let us therefore cheerfully, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, O Chriſtians! let us cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully run to this goal of ſuffering pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently. The croſſe is not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary high whereon we are to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, no rack to rend or wound our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, no red hot gridiron to lye upon, no huge maſſie ſtones to cruſh us, or to be embrewed with our bloud, no frying pans to ſcort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The more labour, the greater ſhall be our reward; the more painfull the combat, the nobler the victory. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on cheerfully.</p>
                     <p>The Germans in times paſt were wont to encourage their Minſtrils at weddings after this manner: Come on Piper, blow up luſtily The greater our miſeries are, the more let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our ſelves; Come on Stephen, John; Come on Paul, cheer up: praiſe God even for this, that it is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſend us miſery. Take heed no bitterneſſe poſſeſſe thy tongue or minde. A merry heart makes a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing old age; a ſad and lumpiſh ſpirit dries the very marrow of the bones. He that bears miſeries with grief and dolour, doth as if he daſhed againſt the walls a fair lute or harp, which he ſhould rather ſing to, or play upon; which Saint Auguſtine moſt truly confirmed, ſaying, If thou beeſt dejected in tribulations, thou haſt broken thy harp. For doubtleſſe through grief of minde the ſpirit is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſaith the Hebrew Wiſeman; If thou ſhak deſpair, being tired out in the day of diſtreſſe, thy ſtrength ſhall be weakened. Then the lute
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:10478:205"/>
and harp are broken, and the muſick marred.</p>
                     <p>Behold Paul of Tarſus, How far was he from breaking his harp? Nay, hear how skilfully he played upon it. I rejoyce (quoth he) in my ſufferings. The ſame example Saint Peter invites us to imitate. Rejoyce (ſaith he) when you communicate with Chriſt in his ſufferings.</p>
                     <p>That Angelicall Meſſenger from heaven, entering Tobies houſe, ſaid: Joy be alwayes unto thee Tobie: Where is thy harp? Why ſingeſt thou not to God? Why driveſt thou not thy grief away with gladneſſe? Tobie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, What joy can I have, ſith I am deſpoiled of my goods, deprived of my ſight, and deſtitute of my friends? But the heavenly young man replyed; Be notwithſtanding alwayes joyfull. Then Tobie anſwers: All joy is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from ſo ſorrowfull a houſe. The Angel aſſures no grief can be where Gods favour (the fountain of all joy) reſides. Tobie replies, that they who are miſerable indeed can hardly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their grief. But the Angel ſaid again: Thou ſhalt ſhortly be cured by the hand of God, be of good courage.</p>

Wherefore, (O my Toby! and thou my Chriſtian brother) be joyfull alwayes, even amongſt tears.

Let thy mouth (whilſt the tears trickle down thy cheeks) ſing and rejoyce; let thy minde be reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and joyfull, whilſt thy face looks pale and wan.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a ſport a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt children to laſh a top with a ſcourge. The manner of it is thus; when the top tired as it were, with long ſtanding begins to ſtagger and reele, as if it would inſtantly fall, the boy fetcheth it up againe with his ſcourge, and ſets it a going, and when it begins afterward to falter, he fetcheth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout againe and againe with his ſcourge, making it ſleepe, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it to dy under his hands. This ſport God playes with the world: God handleth us men like tops; many are ready inſtantly to periſh, when behold God is at their backs, and laſheth them up againe with his ſcourge; he ſtrikes
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:10478:209"/>
to confirme them, and wounds, to cure them; he pulls them down to ſee them up againe: he loads them with evills in this tranſitory world, that he may heape all benefits upon them in the eternall. We are balls, we are tops: it is God that ſtrikes the ball, and whips the top: and this he doth with ſo many blows, with ſo many ſtripes, that we may not only beare our croſſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently and cheerefully, but likewiſe conſtantly. And this is the third man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of carrying our croſſe, to wit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly. Which conſtancy and what kind thereof is neceſſary in adverſity, we will now declare.</p>

                     <p>IT was an old ſaying of the Ancients, To keep ſtill the ſame countenance, is proper to Socrates. Which ſpeech we may ſomewhat alter, ſaying: To retain ſtill one and the ſame minde, is peculiar to a Chriſtian. And this for the moſt part, is the greateſt complaint in the School of Patience, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin many things well, but end them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. It is an ill end, when we fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our works before they come to an
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:10478:209"/>
end. What, I pray, may we thinke of him, who with infinite forwardneſſe takes upon his ſhoulders the croſſe of Chriſt, but finding it more burdenſome then he took it to be, leanes it againſt his neighbours houſe, and confeſſing himſelfe to faint under his burden, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts him to hire a Porter to carry it for him. This man took up his croſſe amongſt others, but he held not out to the end. So ſhall you ſee now and then poore decrepit people take up a burthen of ſtickes in the forreſt to carry home to the fire; but increaſing it (as commonly they do by the way) leave it afterward in the plain field: So we at laſt, having ſpent all our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, breake into theſe complaints: What man living, ſay we, is able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch infinite, ſuch intolerable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Is there any heart in the world that will not breake with theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What man (albeit he were of braſſe) can ſubſiſt amongſt ſo many misfortunes? Theſe calamities are too too long, and even endleſſe. Thus we faint, languiſh, and in the end fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recovery.</p>
                     <p>Who perſevereth to the end, O you good men!) who perſevereth to the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:10478:210"/>
end, ſhall be ſaved. The conſtancie of Chriſt our Lord, how much and how diverſly was it tried on the croſſe? If he be the King of the Jewes, ſay they, if the Sonne of God, let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend now from the croſſe, and we will beleeve in him. But, becauſe he was the Sonne of God (as moſt elegantly anſwereth Saint Chryſoſtome) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſcended not from the croſſe: whereas ſurely it had beene as eaſie for him to have deſcended from the croſſe, as it was to riſe out of the Sepulchre. But to the end he might inſtruct us in patience (ſaith Saint Auguſtine) he deferred his power.

                     <p>It is the Gold-ſmiths Art to know, how long the gold is to be tried in the fire: he takes it not out of the fornace,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:10478:210"/>
before it be throughly purged. So, doubtleſſe, it belongs not to us to know the times or moments which our Father hath reſerved in his own power. We are gold, and God the Gold-ſmith, who will take us out of the fire when it ſhall ſeem good to his divine Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>And behold the obſtinate conſtancy of many men in vile and tranſitory matters. How often ſhall you heare them utter theſe or the like ſpeeches? I ſlack not, or give over what I have once begun, I mean to go thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitch, I will get the upper hand in whatſoever I undertake; either a man or a mouſe, I will either dye or go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the victory, I will take no reſt till I bring this about.

                     <p>GOD loves conſtancie in every good man. And, I beſeech you, let us but think, where, and what we are. In this life we paſſe our novice-ſhip: for we are novices, and this world, (the middle region between heaven and hell) is the place aſſigned to doe it in. As we now behave our ſelves uprightly and conſtantly, or otherwiſe, ſo ſhall we have alotted us an eternall habitation, either in heaven or hell. God here takes a triall of our conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and deferres our reward, that he may render it afterward with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
                     <p>With good reaſon doth Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine wonder, why God, who was ſo intimate with Jacob the Patriarch, would conceal from him ſo long, that his ſon Joſeph was yet alive. The good old man pined away with grief, deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſon Joſeph torn in pieces, and devoured by wilde beaſts. Yet did not
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:10478:212"/>
God ſo much as with one word miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his grief What meant he by this? Surely to try the conſtancie of Jacob. And therefore he doubled his grief, when he bereft him alſo of his dearly beloved ſon Benjamin. With how many experiments (I pray) did God try the conſtancie of Joſeph? He was at the age of ſeventeen ſold by his brothers; ten yeers he paſt in ſervice, where daily his wanton Miſtris ſollicited his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity; but ſo conſtantly did he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand her adulterous deſires, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther threats, tears, nor intreaties could vanquiſh h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Afterward this moſt modeſt young man was caſt into priſon amongſt malefactours, where he ſpent one yeer with the Kings Butler and Baker. After their delivery, he lived yet two yeers longer in that priſon, with marvellous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, patience, and integrity. For referring himſelf with all innocencie to Almighty God, he neither ſought to defend, nor clear himſelf by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how the whole matter had paſſed; but conſtantly endured the neceſſity of his impriſonment, comforting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with this one onely hope, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:10478:212"/>
God (whoſe moſt vigilant provicence he had often notably expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienced) was without all doubt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more able to releaſe him when his bleſſed pleaſure was, then they to hold him in priſon; which evidently appeared afterward: for having layen three yeers in priſon, he was brought forth and preſented to King Pharao, who made him Vice-Roy over all Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. He was then thirty yeers of age, after which time (in that eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, next to the Kings own perſon) he governed Aegypt fourſcore yeers. For ſuch is the uſuall manner of God, far to exceed mens merits with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and infinitely to ſurpaſſe their labours with recompences.</p>
                     <p>Behold the ample honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of conſtant patience: Whoſoever therefore thou art, perſevere faithfull even to death, and thou ſhalt receive the crown of life.</p>
                     <p>Let us contemplate and conſider the whole frame of Nature: What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails it a man to learn ſuperficially any Art or Science, if he attain not to ſuch perfection that he may ſhew himſelf a skilfull Artiſt therein?

The Angel in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps, warneth us to hold what we have, that no man may take our crown from us. This Saint Baſil declareth in an elegant Oration, where he extolls the conſtancie of the forty Martyrs, who in the time of Licinius the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, at Sebaſte, a Citie of Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, were compelled to ſtand naked without doors in a frozen pit, and in the ſharp and rough winter ſeaſon, there to be ſtarved to death. Theſe words and mutuall encouragements were heard amongſt them all: Let us
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:10478:214"/>
fight like Champions, and run this race we have undertaken; at the end thereof we ſhall be crowned. This voice was ratified by celeſtiall viſions. For one of the ſouldiers that guarded them, ſaw Angels ſent from heaven with nine and thirty crowns, to beſtow upon as many of thoſe Christian Champions, which cauſed him to marvell, and ſay within himſelf: Here are forty perſons, but where is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth crown? Whilſt he was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving this in his minde, one of that bleſſed number, too indulgent to his own life, and not able to endure the torments, ſtepped into a warm bath adjoyning. Alas, nice and tender Martyr! What doeſt thou? Shunneſt thou to death? Nay, thou runneſt into it in this place where thou ſeekeſt to avoid it. For ſoon after, the poor wretch, not able to abide the ſudden change from cold to heat, gave up the ghoſt. O miſerable, thrice miſerable wretch! Seeking to shun Sylla, he fell into Charybdis. Short and momentary were the pains he feared, whilſt he incurred eternall; and all this, becauſe he loſt his conſtancie. But the reſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the laſt gaſpe, continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,

or ſun-flower, ſtill to have a mans eie fixed upon this glorious ſun: And this alſo advanced him to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, even before the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (who all his life before had been a deſperate theef) for that from the chair of the croſſe he preached and publiſhed his own wickedneſſe: And we indeed ſuffer juſtly; whereas the other theefe by his ſhameleſſe ſuit for liberty, did as it were deny his owne guiltineſſe.</p>
                     <p>When the enemy was at the very gates of Bethulia, and a pitifull hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all ſorts of people heard throughout the whol city, Judith that moſt chaſt widdow ſtepped out amid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt the thickeſt of them, to raiſe their hopes, and wipe away their teares. Let us not, quoth ſhe, be our owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers: but repute theſe puniſhments, even ſmall ſcourges from our Lord in regard of our ſins, whereby we may rather think he corrects us as ſervants; for our reformation, then that hee ſends them for our utter deſtruction and confuſion.</p>
                     <p>When therefore we are afflicted or puniſhed, let us not impute the fault to others, but our ſelves, and confeſſe our puniſhment much milder then we

                     <p>The other is, The confideration of the will and providence of God. All whatſoever we ſuffer, is by the will of God. He from all eternity not only foreſaw; but alſo was willing that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhould fall into thoſe miſeries which he now falls into; Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeparate the fault from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſin from the affliction, and

ſay, God, who is moſt juſt, though he be not the author of any ſin, yet of all affliction, and puniſhments he is the principall; and as Divines ſay, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive effective cauſe. It is not by the will, but by the permiſſion of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that men commit ſinnes which are oftentimes the cauſes of many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and puniſhments; But after ſin committed, it is his will, becauſe he is juſt, that pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It is therefore from God, and by his will and providence that all cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and miſeries are fallen upon us. It is the pleaſure of God, marke advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly what I ſay, that we ſhould be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with thoſe miſeries wherewith we are oppreſſed: whoſoever therefore thou art, thou muſt willingly ſuffer theſe things; &amp; for this cauſe as Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca admoniſheth, for that you may reſt aſſured they come from the order and decree of God; This moſt loving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breeds his children up ſeverely.</p>
                     <p>We ſee ſometimes boies play in the ſtreets without the leaſt feare of the rod: but ſome honeſt man comes on the ſuddaine unlooked for, and taking one of them by the eare, leads him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his fellows. No man ſees

                     <p>A reward is promiſed to thoſe that begin, but given onely to thoſe that perſevere unto the end. Judas Iſcariot began very well, but ended much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: his beginning was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but his end condemned. Many are ready to begin well, but few end ſo. The vertue of a good worke (by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Saint Gregory) is perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is onely crowned.

                     <p>It is the end doubtleſſe, not the fight that crownes us. Commend a mans proſperous voyage by ſea; but ſee him firſt in a ſafe harbour. It avails but little to take the croſſe upon your ſhoulders, if you carry it not out to the end. Wo be to thoſe who have loſt their ſufferance.

                     <p>THe ancient Germans were wont to inſtruct their children by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, delivered by certain ſignes and tokens; amongſt others this was one: If at any time thou baiteſt by the way in thine inne, part not thence till thou haſt ſpit thrice: meaning hereby, that when they were travellers they ſhould take heed they left none of their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture behinde them. Moreover, they commanded them not to point at the ſtars with their finger; not for that it is an offence to point at the ſtars; but becauſe they thought that curious fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent aſpect was hurtfull to their eyes. This likewiſe was a prudent admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theirs: If any thing hurt or vex thee, ſay, <hi>Deo gratias,</hi> God be thanked; or, <hi>Rependat hoc Deus,</hi> God requite this. A golden precept certainly, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this our preſent purpoſe. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever burns thee, what adverſity ſoever happens to thee, what man ſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures or troubles thee, be ſure to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as ample thanks, as if he had given thee a liberall reward.</p>

In like manner, ſober and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet parents now a dayes teach their children to kiſſe the rod, wherewith they have been beaten. So ſhall you ſee the moſt towardly ſcholars in the ſchool give thanks to their Maſters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have corrected them: as if they ſhould ſay; My moſt reverend Maſter, I take it not ill at your hands to be chaſtiſed, I have deſerved it; and I am the rather joyed and comforted that my Maſter hath ſuch regard over me, and that he hath not as yet laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all hope and care of me: And why ſhould I think much, or finde my ſelf agrieved? It is the Maſters part to correct his ſcholars when they offend, that ſo they may be the more wary in time to come. O this is a diſpoſition as excellent as rare, to receive ſtripes and render thanks! Yet it beſeems us all to do ſo; In all patience and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity, with joy and thankſgiving to God our Father, who hath made us worthy to take part in the lot of Saints. And this doubtleſſe is to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate, this is to have our lot amongſt Saints: To ſuffer much, and render thanks that God vouchſafeth us ſo great an honour.</p>

It is no evill, unleſſe thou wilt: Do but thank God for it, and thou turneſt the evill into good. Say as Job did: The Name of God be bleſſed for ever.

                     <p>What evill ſoever (therefore) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth thee, give God thanks, and thou turneſt the evill into good. And as the ſame Saint Chryſpſtome admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: Let us not repine, be vexed, or troubled in temptations. Job by

                     <p>AND for as much as this we ſpeake off, to wit, that thanks are to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God even in adverſity, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great importance, it will be expedient to confirme it with moſt ample teſtimonies. Saint Chryſoſtome purſuing this ſubject which he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, ſhewes his ſingular elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence therein, and indeed himſelfe to be Chryſoſtome; that is, a golden mouthed oratour, inculcating daily this one thing, as well beſeemed him It is therefore moſt convenient, quoth he, both for rich and poore, as well for ſicke as ſound, for thoſe that ſuffer adverſity as for others that live in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; For what marvell is it for a man to render thanks to God while all things go according to his liking; but when he is toſled and tempeſt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and in manifeſt danger of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, then is his patience and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity moſt put to the proof? And this was that which made Job ſo victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:10478:224"/>
and ſtopped the mouth of his ſhameleſſe adverſary the divell, making it moſt evident that whileſt he was in proſperity he rendred thanks to God, not ſo much for his temporall wealth, as for the great love he bare to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>This is the moſt apparent ſigne and teſtimony of a gratefull mind, and the trueſt proofe of wiſdome, when a man even in adverſity gives thanks and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies God for all things; not only for his benefits, but even for his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for this deſerves a far greater reward: By rendring thanks to God in proſperity thou payeſt only a due debt: but by being thankfull for adverſity, thou makeſt God a debtor to thee; for who receives a benefit, and returns thanks, diſchargeth a duty to his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor: but he that requiteth injuries with good turns, makes a debt due to himſelf. Hence infer, that God when he puniſheth, ought as much to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as when he exempteth from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; Both of them are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alike of his care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, both of his goodneſſe: as much ought he to be praiſed for exiling A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam out of Paradiſe, as for placing
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:10478:225"/>
him there. It is not for Heaven alone we ſhould be thankfull, but even for hell it ſelfe, which he made to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and deter us from ſin.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, as we do not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and comply with our Phyſition when he feeds and nouriſhes us, but alſo when he puniſheth us with ſpare diet; not only when he gives us leave to walke abroad and take the aire, but likewiſe when he confines us to a cloſe chamber; not only when he anoints and foments, but even when he cuts and burns us to the bone, ſeeing theſe contrary courſes tend all to one end; ſo ought we to praiſe God for all things, and ſo much the more, becauſe the one is God, the other but a man. Events amongſt them happen often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contrary to their expectation, but the works of God never without ſupreme wiſdome and providence. Let us then not only thanke God when he grants our petitions, but even when we ſuffer the repulſe; For God in denying is no leſſe our father then in granting our requeſt, and knowes we our ſelves are utterly ignorant what is fit for us to aske.</p>
                     <p>Then whether we obtaine our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:10478:225"/>
or not, we muſt be thankfull. Gratitude is a great pleaſure, great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and unexhauſted good, an armor of proofe; It will mitigate a mans tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, to accompany it with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Vertue doubtleſſe of herſelfe may be ſubject to many deceipts and illuſions: where mercy aboundeth, envy will never be wanting. But the ſtrongeſt ſhield and ſureſt defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all theſe incurſions, is to give God thanks, and glorifie him in all. Haſt thou loſt thy money? Be but thankfull and thou gaineſt thy owne ſoule, and greater riches thereby, as having had an ampler pledge of Gods favour and good will.</p>
                     <p>Saint Auguſtine is of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Good and bad men, ſaith he, are like two veſſells, the one repleniſhed with pretious ſpices, the other with ſtench and rottenneſſe, which being fanned with the ſelfe ſame fanne, the one wherein the ſpices are, breathes forth a gratefull odour, the other an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and intolerable favour. So good and bad men are both vexed and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled alike, but by the deepe diſcuſſion of Gods judgement a great difference is made between the one &amp; the other.</p>

Good men, ſo ſoon as any tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begins to ſeize on them, like ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified veſſels, render thanks to God for this chaſtiſement he vouchſafes them: but the proud, covetous and luxurious, blaſpheme and murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſaying; O God! What evill have we done, that we ſuffer this at thy hands? Hence it often happens, that theſe miſerable wretches entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the love of this tranſitory life, are not able to enjoy it; but (which is worſe) are compelled to loſe the everlaſting; where neither grief nor ſorrow are to be found: and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to avoid preſent evills, for their ſins, fall into eternall torments.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Saint Gregory ſaith: They which fear ſtripes are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, that (if they deſire not to be truly miſerable indeed) they ſhould rather fear eternall puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtories of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers report; That there was amongſt them a certain man, who without any fault of his became odious, and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all mens diſpleaſure: none would admit him into their ſociety, or ſo muth as ſalute him; he could neither borrow book nor bread; and in the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:10478:226"/>
evening, when he had ended his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, was never invited to any of their chambers. Notwithſtanding all this, (for which he is much to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) he rendered thanks to God. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time it happened, that this very man comming home from harveſt, found no manner of victuals to eat. What ſhould he do in this caſe? It was in vain to hope for any at his fellows hands: Should he then beg it at Gods? He did ſo indeed, and from thence was furniſhed. For not long after, a ſtranger, with a camell loaden with bread, knocked at the gates. When this holy man perceived the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive bounty of Gods providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he wept, ſaying; Am I then my good God (ſaid he) am I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to ſuffer a little penury for thy ſake? But from that time forward, all his fellows ſhewed themſelves reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive towards him, and, as the ſame Authour ſaith, were reconciled to him.</p>

                     <p>TObias that excellent old man, ſo approved for his patience, found himſelf nothing agrieved, nor any way repined againſt God for the ſad diſtaſter of his blindneſſe; but perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, notwithſtanding, immoveable in his fear and reverence, giving him humble thanks all the dayes of his life. This is a pattern we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deavour all we can to imitate. When we are deſpiſed, laughed to ſcorn, and made odious; when we are caſt head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into many miſeries, let us render thanks to God: Whereby, moved through his infinite goodneſſe, he will either (as it hath been often experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) aſſwage the rage of our enemies, or largely recompence, by ſome other means, this evill, how great ſoever it be.</p>
                     <p>This is the opinion of Saint Paul, who exhorts us to give thanks in all things; which Saint Hierome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, ſaith; The Jews and idolaters know how to render thanks for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but the Chriſtians alone for cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and afflictions.

                        </gap> third book of the Imitation of Chriſt, in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth chapter, diſcourſeth ſo notably, that I think it were expedient for all that are afflicted, grieved, or by any means whatſoever moleſted, to read every day this chapter, or at leaſt ſome part of it. Out of which, we bring this for our purpoſe: I render thanks to thee, my Lord God, for that thou haſt not ſpared to afflict me with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, but haſt ſcourged me with ſharp ſtripes, inflicting puniſhment, and diſtreſſing me both inwardly and outwardly. Thy diſcipline is upon me, and thy rod it ſelf will comfort me.</p>
                     <p>A Prelate of great note recounts, that a certain man very remarkable for learning, required of a certain religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Virgin a compendious way to lead a holy life; which ſhe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in ten documents, whereof this was the fift; That how great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were the affliction a man ſuffered, he ſhould render thanks, think himſelf unworthy of it, and deſire to have a greater, and even doubled: which ſhe
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:10478:228"/>
doubtleſſe her ſelf daily practiſed. And what, I pray, ſhould hinder us from imitating a thing ſo well worthy imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>What we have ſaid, may well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by example. A poor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man hath coughed all night, counted every ſtroke of the clock; without taking any ſleep or reſt, till even his very heart ſtrings are broken. It were a brave &amp; bold reſolution for this man to ſay; Giue me, my Lord God, a more vehement cough, to vex me more, for my ſins have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</p>
                     <p>A man tormented with the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, griping of the ſtomack, the ſtone, the gout; and yet having theſe words ſtill in his mouth: Double, good Lord, my pain, ſo thou double my patience. Which, or where is this man, and we will commend him?</p>
                     <p>Let me ſee a man openly jeered and laught to ſcorn by three or foure mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king companions, and yet ſay: O my Chriſt! how many times haſt thou been laught to ſcorn for me? Set more upon me, to deride and affront me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I have ſurely deſerved it. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to find any one pray in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:10478:228"/>
Some certainly there are, but concealed, who ſecretly ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with patience. There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome, who will pray after this manner: My deare God! it is not one affliction alone I ſuffer, I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with many: but I beſeech thee (my Lord) ſend me greater, augment my miſeries: for I am well aſſured thou wilt withall increaſe my patience. For the preſent I yeeld thee humble thankes for theſe I ſuffer, and thinke my ſelfe unworthy to ſuffer for thee, my God.</p>
                     <p>Have we ever prayed thus in our lives? or ſhall we pray ſo hereafter? O Chriſtians! many times after we have ſaid theſe or the like prayers, we flatter our ſelves with a ſuppoſed kinde of ſanctity; But, alas! how farre are we as yet from true patience? we play the men, nay the gyants, in our owne conceits, whilſt we exerciſe theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; but no man here can rightly judge, none rightly commend, but God himſelfe, the onely ſearcher of hearts, who amongſt all other muſicall inſtruments, chiefly commendeth two, the Taber and the Organs; <hi>Tynipanu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is the part of a good religious man, to render God moſt humble thankes in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. If thou beeſt Iron, this fire will ſcoure off thy ruſt; if gold, refine thee. If it be the will of God to afflict thy body, what doth it availe to repine or ſtand againſt it? Endure it therefore, and humbly beſeech God to grant thee that, which may moſt ſtand with his will and pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>We muſt not fail to inculcate even a thouſand times that divine admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of John Avila. One <hi>Deo gratias</hi> in adverſitie, is better then ſix thouſand in proſperity. Queſtionleſſe, it is a high point of ſpirituall prudence, to be thankfull to God in adverſity.</p>
                     <p>There is great difference between meats that are ſpitted, and laid to the fire: for if a leane, dry Capon, or Chickens are to be roſted, the Cooke muſt of neceſſity oftentimes powre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them melted butter; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, it will be but a
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:10478:231"/>
poore dry diſh of meat to ſend to the table; but if it be an excellent Gooſt, a crammed Pullet, a fat Capon, a piece of ſtall fed Biefe, a well liking Pig, or a ſpeciall fat Turkey; theſe will be ſo farre from needing any other baſting then that they bring with them, that they will leave behinde them a great quantity of dripping. And theſe are choyce meats indeed, fit to be ſerved in to a Kings table.</p>
                     <p>So for all the world is it with thoſe kind of men, who have ſtill been dry and lean in ſpirit, who have neither minde, nor ſenſe, nor devotion, nor fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, if you lay them to the fire of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; O what a poore piece of roſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat ſhall you finde them! well may conſolation, as butter, be powred upon them, but it avails them little, they mourne and lament paſt recovery. They want the fatneſſe of a good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, baſt them never ſo much, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help them; no comfort can you give them will ever perſwade them to patience.</p>
                     <p>But they who have plentifully fed upon the precepts of Patience, and have wholly devoted themſelves to the will of God (being once ſcorched with
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:10478:231"/>
the fire of calamity) moſt of all ſhew forth the fatneſſe of their devotion; their minde and courage is preſent with them, and undaunted; they are able to comfort both themſelves and others, they ſtick not to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the meaneſt offices that are, they give thanks for their miſeries, and deſire their calamities may be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thus do they baſt themſelves with their own fatneſſe. Theſe, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, are dreſſed and prepared for that great and royall feaſt, whereunto the gueſts are invited in theſe words: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have made ready my dinner, killed my oxen and fatlings, all is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: come to my marriage.</p>
                     <p>But as the fat roaſt meat yeelds a better ſavour then boyld: ſo thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving is by thoſe, who are daily roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted as it were, with the fire of griefe and tribulation, far more pretious and acceptable unto God, then theirs who combat onely with light inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſail in a calm and peaceable ſea.</p>
                     <p>Noah, with his companions, after the deluge, wherein the whole world was drowned, celebrated a ſolemne feaſt of thankſgiving: for he erected an Altar,

ſelected out of the heards of cattel, and flocks of birds, the choiceſt victimes, and offered an holocauſt. <hi>Odora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But think now with what miſeries, &amp; how long Noah had been formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed.

For, to ſay nothing elſe of the tediouſnes of the Ark, which was no leſſe to him then a ten months ſepulchre, what may be imagined more irkſome, then to lie all that time, as it were, buried in the dung of beaſts. He had no ſooner overcome theſe ſo great difficulties, but he fel into a new miſery: he perceived himſelf laught to ſcorn by his own ſon, inſomuch that he was even forced with his owne mouth to curſe him, who a little before through the great mercy of God had been preſerved from the deluge. Thus God received as a moſt acceptable ſacrifice, Noahs conſtant patience and thankſgiving, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt adverſity, and in requitall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded

                     <p>The contrary courſe is wont, and ought to be obſerved in this School of ours; for when the Scholars of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſee a cup brim full of bitterneſſe, they pray indeed with Chriſt, Father, let this Cup paſſe from me: But thoſe very prayers, how hot &amp; vehement ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are thus by reſtriction qualified: Let thy will, notwithſtanding, not

mine be fulfilled. Thus they deſire to be delivered, ſo it may ſtand with the will of God. But when they render thanks, they do it entirely, without the leaſt reſtriction, with infinite fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour both of minde and voice; after this manner: I render thee, O my God! infinite and immortall thanks, that thou vouchſafeſt me ſo great an honour, by ſending me ſomewhat to ſuffer for thy ſake; that thou reckoneſt me amongſt thy children: And what childe is there, I pray, whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrects not?

thee, that thou mayeſt receive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance from God who reforms thee. When he afflicts one in this world, it is to admoniſh, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him. He bears patiently with ſinners, not exerciſing his anger, but expecting their repentance.</p>
                     <p>But do we not often give thanks for a poor trifle, which we would as willingly be without, onely becauſe we hope to receive ſome better gift ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time? For he that is gratefull for the firſt, deſerves to have it ſeconded. For this cauſe therefore, he that hath but even the leaſt policy or prudence in him, will ſtrive to be gratefull, even for an ungratefull benefit: for he will reaſon thus with himſelf: He certainly that gave this gift, did it out of a good diſpoſition towards me, and ſhould I not take this thankfully, it were the way to deprive me of all future bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. This even reaſon it ſelf teacheth us: But that which is a light above reaſon, tells us: That God in this world ſcatters onely copper and leaden money amongſt us; he beſtows crowns, but ſuch as are thornie and bloudy; which doubtleſſe he doth to this end, that he may ere long
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:10478:234"/>
give golden Crownes beſet with pretious gemmes.</p>
                     <p>Why therefore do we not, as beſt beſeems us, give thanks to this moſt loving Father for this lead and thorns, which ſhortly ſhall be turned to gold and precious jewells? Let us accept this lead, embrace theſe thorns, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering no leſſe thanks for them, then if they were the greateſt wealth and treaſure. Theſe are moſt true pledges and pawns for the gold and precious pearls which he will give us. He that ſhall be humbled, ſhall be in glory, and he that ſhall incline his eyes, ſhall be ſaved.</p>

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:10478:237"/>
I never imagined this fortune was reſerved for me: a wiſe man knows and conſiders all that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him: whatſoever comes to paſſe, he ſaies, I knew and foreſaw this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand; all events therefore are to be thought of, and our mind prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fortified againſt all that may happen. Thinke on exiles, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wars, ſhipwracks, diſeaſes. Set before your eies the whole ſtate of humane condition: let us anticipate and foreſee (if we deſire not to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on the ſuddain, or daunted at any thing as ſtrange and unuſuall) not only what doth often, but even what for the moſt part may happen unto us.</p>
                     <p>It is the mind that makes a mans life either happy or miſerable; An e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil man converts all into evill, even thoſe enterpriſes which at firſt were moſt hopefull: an upright and ſincere man, corrects ſiniſter fortune, qualifies ſharpe and diſaſtrous accidents, by a moderate and skilfull bearing them.

                     <p>To a minde thus compoſed, nothing ſhall fall out amiſſe, and ſo ſurely it may be compoſed, if it conſider but before hand how far the various ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of things in this world may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelfe.

                     <p>Plutarch reports that Uliſſes, after he had ſpent twenty yeares in warfare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his country, and ſitting with his wife Penelope, while ſhe wept and was drowned in teares, he ſhed none himſelfe, nor was ſenſible of any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo well was his minde eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before hand and fortified againſt

                     <p>We muſt addreſſe and compoſe our minds to this neceſſity of ſuffering, we muſt follow and obey, and ſuppoſe all that is done ought neceſſarily to be <note place="margin">Except ſin.</note> done.

                     <p>It is too late after dangers, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the mind to Patience in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.

What kingdome is there in the world which is not reſerved for ruine, or contempt, to be trampled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſome Lord or other, as alſo by his baſe executioner? Neither is the time long before this comes to paſſe, there is but the diſtance of one minute of an howre many times, between a kingdome transferred from one King to another; know then by this, that all eſtates are caſuall and uncertain; and whatſoever happens unto others, may befall thee likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>It was the ſaying of Socrates: that
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:10478:241"/>
as mariners, that ſaile in calm and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et weather, go provided of inſtruments to ſerve them in a tempeſt: ſo thoſe that are wiſe make proviſion in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity for adverſity. This if a man would ſeriouſly conſider, and behold other mens miſeries (whereof he hath an infinit number daily before his eies) as if they had a way altogether as open to him, he would long before the blow comes, ſet a guard upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>It is an ordinary ſaying, forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, forearmed; and labours fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, as Saint Gregory ſaith, are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone with more eaſe. Saint Hierom was altogether of the ſame minde; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this miſerable life, quoth he, is altered and perplexed every day with interchangeable events, let a juſt man prepare his mind as well for adverſity, as proſperity; that whatſoever happens he may bear it with a free and reſolute mind; And I pray, my Chriſtian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thinke not thy ſelfe called to the Schoole of Patience to be laid upon a ſoft couch, or to be cockered with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry delights; thou art deceived; my dearſt, thou art deceived; Thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to this Schoole, to wraſtle, to
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:10478:241"/>
fight, to be tried, and to be exerciſed with many incommodities. See then thou prepare thy minde to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But the beſt preparation in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is, to treat often with God in prayer. Hither in all calamities muſt you have your recourſe, heer muſt you breathe forth all your ſighes, hither muſt you chiefly addreſſe your ſelves to have help from heaven. The Apoſtles pointed out even with their finger, whither they would have you to haſten in all your diſtreſſes. For whilſt they were amidſt the boiſterous ſtormes of the ſea, they cried out to Chriſt, Save us, O Lord! our God, our power, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, our helper in all tribulations which do exceedingly aſſault us.</p>
                     <p>Here Saint Auguſtine gives this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: There are ſome refuges, (ſaith he) that yeeld no ſuccour, a man ſhall finde himſelfe rather diſ-inabled then ſtrengthened by them. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Thou ſtreſt to ſome great man in the world, to make him thy potent friend; thou ſeemeſt now to have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a ſecure refuge (a weak one God knowes) for whereas thou hadſt not any reaſon ſo much to feare or doubt
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:10478:242"/>
thy cauſe, now thou art as fearfull of him to whom thou fledſt for refuge. For many in flying to theſe men, fall together with them to whom they have betaken themſelves, and ſo are the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſcovered, who would never have been ſought for, had they not ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves under their protection. We have no ſuch refuge, but ours is power it ſelfe; in flying thither, we are ſafe and ſure from all dangers.</p>

If God ſtand on our ſide, albeit mountaines daſh one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and fall headlong into the ſea, heaven and earth go together, hell it ſelfe gape wide open, and the whole frame of the world be diſſolved<hi>:</hi> all this ruine cannot affright us, we will not feare.</p>

Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes had good reaſon to ſay ſo, and Anaxagoras made good proofe of it, being apprehended at Athens, received two meſſages, both heavie and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<hi>:</hi> The one declared, That death was denounced againſt him; to which Anaxagoras anſwered thus: Nature hath long ſince decreed the ſame, both againſt me, and thoſe that condemne me. The other gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That his children were dead. His anſwer was: I was alwayes ſure my children were not immortall.

                     <p>This is Chriſtian Philoſophy: That Chriſt ſending his Apoſtles into the theatre of the world, ſaid: Behold, I ſend you as ſheep in the midſt of wolves.

                     <p>I have heard a goodly ſtory of an Abbot, whoſe cuſtome was, before he received any novice into his houſe, to carry him to the top of a tower, and bid him view as farre as he could with his eyes, and thinke, that if there were as many croſſes as could ſtand between him and the utmoſt of his proſpect, yet would they not be ſo many, as he muſt expect to beare.

                     <p>Felicitas, the mother of ſeven chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a woman highly commended by Saint Auguſtine, being a priſoner, and ſharply travelling in child-bed, could not with-hold her ſelfe from ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>riking and crying out: One of the Jaylours men hearing her cry out in that manner, bitterly ſcoffing, ſaid: O woman! if thou beeſt not able ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:10478:248"/>
to beare theſe pains, what wilt thou do when thou ſhalt be burned, cut, mangled, and torn in pieces? Know what thou ſuffereſt now, is but in jeſt, then we ſhall fall to plain ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. Her anſwer to this was moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Chriſtian like. Reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, my friend; now I ſuffer onely for my ſelfe, but then Chriſt will ſuffer in me. And as ſhe ſaid, ſo it came to paſſe: for when ſhe was afterward throwne to the wild beaſts, ſhe neither ſhrik't nor cry'd, nor ſo much as fetcht a ſigh. A man would rather have thought ſhe had been taken out to dance, with ſo cheerfull a countenance did ſhe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death<hi>:</hi> And all becauſe thou (my Lord) waſt her patience.</p>
                     <p>Juſt after this manner muſt we fight, if we look to get the victory. So ſoon as any tempeſt of adverſitie begins to riſe, forthwith let us fly, with all our heart, to God, and wholly ſubmit our ſelves to his divine will; yea, even drench and ingulfe ourſelves therein, be ſorry, with all our hearts, that we have ſinned and offended him, humbly beg his divine aſſiſtance, and firmly purpoſe never to depart from him in adverſity, truſting in him, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:10478:248"/>
all things elſe to his providence. This augments our patience, this is that which makes us bold and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>
                     <p>Vitruvius recounts, that Ariſtippus, when he was, by the violence of the ſea, caſt upon the Iſle of Rhodes, in a torn and weather-beaten ſhip, found, after he had a while curiouſly looked about, certain Mathematicall figures drawn with a compaſſe upon the ſhore; whereupon, turning to his companions, Be of good comfort, my friends, quoth he, there is yet ſome hope<hi>:</hi> for we may ſee here have been men.</p>
                     <p>Whenſoever we turn our ſelves to God in prayer, we read in him the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of his immenſe power, and our owne beatitude, written and engraved there. Let us therefore hope well and be conſident, even after ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack: let neither loſſe of money, fame, nor any thing elſe grieve us, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heaven it ſelfe promiſed us.</p>
                     <p>What a poore thing is it to grieve at the loſſe of a few farthings, being to receive a kingdome? why feare we to dye, being to be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to immortality? After all tempeſts and ſhipwrackes, our good God
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:10478:249"/>
will bring us to a ſafe and ſure haven if (my deare Chriſtian brother) thou doe but offer thy ſelfe, how poore and miſerable ſoever to his divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>The Acaronites being infeſted with mice, made images of thoſe creatures in gold, and offered them to God; and found thereby a remedy of that miſchiefe. The Iſraelites likewiſe, ſtung by Serpents, were cured by the braſen Serpent: ſo it goes with us; the very ſame weapon that inflicts the wound heales it; calamity whilſt it oppreſſeth us, erects us to God-ward, (ſuppoſing the fault be not in our ſelves) if we prepare our ſoule to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

A man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the heart of God, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and faſhioned himſelfe moſt exactly to his divine will and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in all things. But contrarywiſe his ſonne Salomon was like an Egge drowned in the ſweet and freſh pooles of pleaſures and delights. It was not
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:10478:250"/>
for that Salomon knew not the will of God, but becauſe he conformed not himſelfe unto it.</p>
                  <p>In our third part we have ſet downe five meanes by which all kindes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities are to be endured. 1. patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. 2. cheerefully. 3. conſtantly. 4. with thankeſ-giving. 5. with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation. the 6. and laſt, but the moſt profitable and neceſſary, is this which followes, to wit, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our will to Gods. And allbeit I have already treated of this conformity to the will of God in my five bookes intituled <hi>Helitropium,</hi> yet I will here in as briefe a manner as I can confirme it, ſeeing it is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the inſtruction of patience, but will not make any repetition of that which hath beene ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>No will either of men or Angels could ever be termed good, or well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, unleſſe it were correſpondent and conformed to the will of God. And the more fully and ſincerely it is reſigned, the more perfect and better it is. And conſequently the leſſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and reſigned the will is, the more unſtable and unperfect. The will of God alone is the ſquare and rule of all
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:10478:250"/>
wills both in heaven and earth. There is no will praiſe-worthy, which is not conformed to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>That moſt bleſſed King David of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten commendeth thoſe that are of an upright heart: Shew, ſaith he, thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy juſtice to thoſe that are upright of heart. This, Saint Auguſtine, a moſt learned interpreter, explicateth in this manner: They, ſayth he, are upright of heart, who in this life follow the will of God. It is the will of God thou ſhouldeſt ſometimes be ſicke, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times well. If when thou art in health the will of God be ſweet and pleaſing unto thee, and if ſicke, harſh and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtefull, thou art not upright of heart: why? becauſe thou wilt not ſquare and direct thy will to the will of God, but rather ſeekeſt to pervert and wreſt the will of God to thine. His will is ſtraight, thine crooked. Thou muſt rectifie thy will according to his, not wreſt his to thine; and thus doing thou ſhalt have an upright heart. Doe al! things ſucceed according to thy hearts deſire? Bleſſe God who comforts thee: Suffereſt thou in this world? Bleſſe God who corrects and
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:10478:251"/>
tries thee. And by this means thou ſhalt be upright of heart, ſaying I will bleſſe God in all times; for he only is thought to have an upright heart, who wills alwaies that which God wills.</p>
                  <p>This one document in this reſpect goes beyond all other precepts; this is the ſumme and principall effect of all admonitions; the abſtract and epitome of holy Scripture: the compendium of all vertues: the chiefeſt ſolace in whatſoever griefes; the higheſt pitch of divine love: the only thing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles the diſciples of the croſſe to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and advanceth men to the ſeats of Angels: This one leſſon, namely, for man to conforme his will, to Gods will, is all in all, and before all to be learned of all men: For whoſoever hath learned this alone in the Schoole of Patience, may in a manner give up ſchoole, and of a ſcholar become a maſter and teacher of others.</p>
                  <p>This certainly King David might by good right chalenge to himſelf before all others, being a man ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the will of God; of which divine knowledge he gave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moſt remarkable proofes, but then chiefly, when flying from his ſon Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:10478:251"/>
he willed the Prieſts to return with the arke, and ſaid: If I ſhall find favour in the eies of my Lord, he will bring me backe, and ſhew it me againe, and his tabernacle: but if he ſhall ſay to me thou pleaſeſt me not, I am ready prepared, let him do what ſeemeth good to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Behold here King David, who even in a flight ſo full of danger and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, put to his utmoſt plunges, when his whole kingdome ſeemed to lie at ſtake, was undaunted, and ſo much himſelf, that attending reſolutely to the will of God alone, yea and to the leaſt ſigne thereof, he willed only that which God willed. Is it the will of God I ſhould return? It is my will alſo. Would he not have me return? I will not go backe; Let my Lord do what ſeemes good in his own ſight, I am prepared.</p>

                     <p>O Chriſtians! if we could but once ſufficiently apprehend this, if we would but deepely imprint it in our minds, the whole matter were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely effected: calamity perhaps might
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:10478:252"/>
touch us, but from thence forward ſhould never hurt us, nor affliction op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe us, nor mortall man be able to annoy us: we ſhould ſtand invincible, impregnable, fortified only with the will of God, our goods perhaps, our money, our health, our fame might go to wracke; But we ſhould ſtand: Cities and Kingdoms might fall to ruine; But we ſhould ſtand; Atlas, and all the world with him might fall to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; But we ſhould ſtand; The heavens themſelves might be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; But we ſhould ſtand immoveable, as long as this conformity of our will with Gods, ſhould ſtand in us. This moſt evidently appeared in Chriſt at mount Olivet, the day before his paſſion; For after he had wholly reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his will to his Fathers, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with made towards his enemies, as an innocent lambe goes towards the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to be ſlaughtered; before he made this prayer, he was all appaled, puſillanimous and troubled at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſo horrible a death; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he had abſolutely confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his will to the will of his Father: Ariſe, quoth he, come, let us go and throw our ſelves into the armes of
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:10478:252"/>
our enemy, and receive his kiſſes.</p>
                     <p>This prompt reſignation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the will of God, makes a man undertake all: he is thereby ſo ſtrong and mighty, he performs all, ſo ſtout and couragious he vanquiſhes all enemies, ſo invincible and inexpugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he gets the upper hand and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes whatſoever hee encounters. And therefore the more devoted and ready a man is to accompliſh the will of God, the more powerfull and able he is to do or ſuffer whatſoever he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes. There is no calamity, no griefe can draw other words from him then theſe: As it hath pleaſed our Lord, ſo is it come to paſſe, ſo let it come to paſſe; for from him is my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; which Saint Auguſtine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well expreſſeth, ſaying; what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience could ever hold out ſo many ſcandalls, were it not for hope of that which as yet we ſee not, but expect with patience? My pains and griefes now approach, my reſt and quietneſſe are likewiſe at hand: my tribulation now aſſailes me, and the time will come ere long I ſhall be clearly purged from it: would you have gold bright and pure before it comes out of the
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:10478:253"/>
gold-ſmiths forge? content your ſelf, you ſhall ſhortly ſee it ſhine in a jewel or golden carcanet: let it a Gods name paſſe the forge, that, when it is purified, it may come to light. In the forge there is fuell, gold and fire, which the gold-ſmith blows: the coles burn in the forge, the gold is purged, the one is turned to aſhes, the other tried and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. This world is a forge or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; wicked men are fuell, juſt men the gold, tribulation the fire, and God the Gold-ſmith. Wherefore as the Gold-ſmith pleaſeth to diſpoſe of me I am content: my part is to ſuffer, and his to purifie: let the fuell burn till it even melt and ſeem to conſume me, when it is burnt to aſhes, I ſhall be purged and refined: and why? becauſe my ſoul ſhall be ſubjected unto God.</p>
                     <p>Behold an intire and perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance of the will of man with the will of God: whereof that religious writer ſpake moſt truly: There is not, ſaith he, any ſacrifice greater or more acceptable to God, then for a man in all tribulation to conforme himſelfe to Gods bleſſed will and pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Oftentimes did God, as one would have thought, ſhew himſelfe mutable
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:10478:253"/>
and unconſtant towards Abraham, as if he would do one while one thing, another while another, and croſſe and command contrary to his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; which he did, doubtleſſe, to this end, to increaſe in ſo faithfull a ſervant, this conformity of his will with his Lords. Mark adviſedly the minde of Abraham: How often ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God varied his commands, were the labours never ſo troubleſome, that he enjoyned him, the trials and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes never ſo bitter that he put upon him, Abraham was ſtill ready at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turn, every the leaſt beck and ſigne of Gods will, to will or nill the ſame with God.</p>

                     <p>We may obſerve a great difference between the Scholars of Patience: Some you ſhall ſee come to the School bare-headed, and without a hat, bare-foot and bare-leg'd, and without a cloake, after the manner of poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; others without any uſe of feet at all, rather creeping then going to this Schoole: Another ſort of them that come indeed on their feet, and in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:10478:254"/>
decent enough, but without either paper, pen, ink, or books, quite deſtitute of means to learn: Others accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated well enough with theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but not ſo much as a peny in their purſe to pay their maſter. Others have pay ſufficient to entertain their maſter, but want wit themſelves to entertain learning. Finally, there are ſome great mens ſons, who come on horſe-back, or in coach to the School of Patience, with much eaſe, and very commodiouſly.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of the firſt ſort come to this School, without either hat, ſhooes, or cloak, as being yet impatient, having not ſo much as learnt to beare adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty patiently: they cannot ſo much as diſſemble or hide their impatience; men without hat or cloake; too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently unperfect.</p>
                     <p>The other ſort creep miſerably to this School, ſome patience indeed they have learned, which would prove none at all, were it not perforce; and fear, or money perſwades them to that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they make ſhew of. Theſe, doubtleſſe, ſuffer nothing with a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart.</p>
                     <p>The third ſort come indeed to the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:10478:254"/>
School of Patience, but utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all Scholaſtick furniture, like Scholars that come at all adventures, and <hi>ex tempore</hi> they will ſit, perhaps, an houre or two and hearken attentively; but ſoon will they wax weary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and in fine forſake the School: they have a wandring minde, indocible, and conſtantly not capable of any thing.</p>
                     <p>Now ſome there are that come bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared to heare their maſter, but without ſtipend to conſider him for his pains. The due entertainment and ſalary which Scholars in the School of Patience ſhould give to their maſter, is, Thankſgiving in adverſity: this many of them, through dulneſſe of wit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not; or if they do, regard not. Notwithſtanding theſe bear the ſhew of conſtant proficients, and capable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of other School-diſciplines; but to render thankes to God for ſtripes and afflictions, this ſurely they have not yet learned; and conſequently are much hindered by poverty, from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dues to their maiſter.</p>
                     <p>But, perhaps, others there are, that want not ſo much pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as wit themſelves; inſomuch that
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:10478:255"/>
they ſuffer griefe and adverſitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all premeditation. This argues a great defect of wit, not to foreſee thoſe things which may and are wont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall every man, and to uſe thoſe poore ſilly words: I would never have thought it.</p>
                     <p>Finally, others are carried on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, or in waggons, both to and from the School of Patience; men highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with divine favours, and who reſigne themſelves wholly to Gods will in all things; but eſpecially in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie; which, doubtleſſe, works this effect in them, not ſo much to render them not ſenſible of the croſſe, as to beare it with facilitie, having alwayes a moſt attentive eye upon the will of God. Theſe do not onely patiently, cheerfully, conſtantly, but even with thankſgiving, and not without preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; and, which is the chiefeſt matter of all, with great conformity of their will to Gods, beare all adverſity whatſoever. All things go well with theſe men, even when they go worſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they are carried ſafe and ſure in the chariot of divine providence. Every one of theſe have in their mouthes theſe words: The Lord ruleth m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="495" facs="tcp:10478:255"/>
nothing ſhall be wanting to me. The Lord is carefull of me. All things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to theſe mens wiſhes; all things ſort to their wils, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will it; ſeeing the main ſcope of their wills is, To will that which God wills. Are they ſick, or ill at eaſe? they know that this is part of Gods will. Do they undergo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, feares, endammagements? They know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe things uſually come to paſſe, and are rather decretall, then accidentall. Do they behold the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie departure of ſome of their friends? the immature death of other ſome of them? They acknowledge life, death, &amp; whatſoever paſſeth in the courſe of our life, to be the will of God. Thus they aſſent to God in all things, they follow God: not upon neceſſity, nor by compulſion; but willingly, and with all their hearts. They never entertain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing (how bitter ſoever it be) with ſad or ſowre lookes: whatſoever tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is exacted from them in this life, they yeeld it willingly.</p>
                     <p>For all things which we feare or groan under in this world, are but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of this life, whereof we muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope nor f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="496" facs="tcp:10478:256"/>
conclude, theſe people, who are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the divine wil, do like a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full harper, who ſtraineth, ſetteth up and letteth down the ſtrings of his harp, till he brings them at laſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect concordance: So whoſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to make his will conſonant to Gods, muſt never ceaſe to incite, urge, inſtruct and correct his own, till it be perfectly ſubjected to the will of God.</p>
                     <p>According to that expoſtulation which the Kingly Pſalmiſt uſed in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner with himſelfe: ſhall not my ſoule be ſubject to God? for of him is my ſalvation. As it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our Lord, ſo is it done: as it ſhall be the will in heaven, ſo be it done. Shall not therefore my ſoul be ſubject unto God?

                     <p>NEither ought this conformity of mans will to Gods, ſeeme hard to any one. What have we more in our power then to will or nill? And what is more familiar, or leſſe troubleſome to a man, then to grant or deny?</p>
                     <p>Alexander King of Macedon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the ſtudy of Geometry, having a great deſire to know how bigge the circuite of the whole earth was, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of then he poſſeſt but the leaſt part. The precepts which were given him were ſubtile, and not to be learned without diligent attention, a thing not ſo eaſie for a military man, whoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, for the moſt part, were wandring beyond ſeas. This ſcholar therfore wil'd his maſter to teach him only ſome eaſie obſervations. His ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:10478:257"/>
anſwer was, that theſe precepts were to every man the ſame, and of like difficulty to all.</p>
                     <p>I may in a manner ſay the ſame, concerning the conformity of mans wil with Gods: theſe are to al men one and the ſame, to Will or Nill ought ſeem to every one of like facility: We are all indifferently both poore and rich of equall ability, without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or coſt of ours, to Will or Nill infinite things: yea, every day we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Will or Nill. But to Will or Nill many things, is no commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, unleſſe both the one and the other be conformable to the will of God: this is vertue, this is praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy indeed.</p>
                     <p>Palladius and Ruffinus recount a wonderfull ſtory: Paphnutius perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelfe he had ſo profited in the way of our Lord, that out of a ſincere and pious curioſity, he beſought God to declare unto him whether any man in the world were equal to him in piety of life. The divine goodneſſe conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to his requeſt, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an Angel to ſignifie unto him, that there was a poore Piper in a village not farre off, who was altogether his
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:10478:257"/>
equall in ſanctity. Paphnutius ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at this meſſage, and muſing much with himſelfe: Is it ſo indeed (thought he) haſt thou endeavoured ſo many yeares with ſo little profit, that thou art only equalled now with a poore minſtrell? And forthwith he undertooke, with all the induſtry he might, to finde out this man, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly enquired of him, what courſe of life he led, and what vertues he moſt practiſed? The poore man ſmiling at ſo curious a queſtion, beganne plainely to confeſſe the truth: In times paſt, ſaid hee, I was a theefe and robber on the high way, now a Piper. For my vertues, good man, it is in vain to aske of them; I have none, and therefore can give you no account of their names. Paphnutius perſiſted ſtill to urge, wiſhing him at leaſt to tel, whether he had at any time done any good or notable act. Alaſſe, ſir! quoth he, it is loſt labour to ſift into my conſcience; you ſhall finde it utterly barren and fruitleſſe. I have beene a ſlave to luſt and drunkenneſſe: yet this one thing I remember, that once we tooke a religious woman, to whom my fellowes would have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:10478:258"/>
violence, had not I delivered her, and conducted her ſafe to the next towne: Another act of mine likewiſe comes to my minde, ſeeing you preſſe me ſo far, and are pleaſed to hear, what perhaps is not fitting for me to utter.</p>
                     <p>Some few years ſince, I found a fair comely yong woman wandring in the woods, bitterly weeping; and asking the cauſe of her teares: Queſtion me not, ſaid ſhe, who am the moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate woman living: but if you can helpe me to any ſervice, diſpoſe of me at your pleaſure; my poore diſtreſſed husband, bound for a huge unpayable debt of another mans, lies in priſon almoſt at the point of death: neither have I any hope of his liberty; Three ſons of late I had, which now, alas! I can no longer call mine, the creditours having ſeazed upon them to ſerve as ſlaves in lieu of the debt; I my ſelfe, ſought after to be uſed in the ſame manner, have fled hither almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with hunger and miſery, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all counſell, helpe or comfort. At this dolefull relation, I, ſaid the minſtrell, being ready to commiſerate perſons ſo unmercifully handled, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be the bleſſed will and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:10478:258"/>
pleaſure of God to give ſo good an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and object of charity, brought this poor woman almoſt famiſhed to my houſe, where when I had refreſhed her with meat, relying on the great goodnes of God, I brought her back to the city from whence ſhe came, &amp; with a ſum of money redeemed and ſet at liberty both her husband and children.</p>
                     <p>Now, reverend Sir, aske me no more queſtions, I beſeech you, I have given you already a liſt of all my vertues; I could much ſooner have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you one of my vices.</p>
                     <p>But I, ſaid Paphnutius, fetching a deep ſigh, have underſtood that thou art no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to me, who inhabit the deſert, &amp; afflict my body with rigour &amp; auſterity; ſeeing therefore thou art ſo much in Gods favour, that ſcarcely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ſervants are in more, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a zealous will and deſire only to be holy, is the prime ſourſe and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of all ſanctity, have a care, I beſeech thee, of thy ſelfe; do but once ſeriouſly will and deſire it, and it is as good as effected; this onely is to be done, deny thy ſelfe, take up thy croſſe, and follow Chriſt; At this the minſtrell, as if he had clearly
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:10478:259"/>
heard theſe words ſpoken and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God himſelf, throwing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his pipe, which he had then in his hand, performed it preſently, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Paphnutius.</p>
                     <p>Here may I with juſt cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime. Take heed; O you ſcholars! who perſwade your ſelves you have profited ſo much in the Schoole of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; take heed, I ſay, leſt theſe very punies go beyond you. It is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome now and then in Schools, to call a petty out of the loweſt forme, to tell ſome blockiſh ſcholar of the higheſt, wherein he hath groſſely erred; we may almoſt ſee the like in this. Theeves and pipers, ſcholars of the loweſt claſſe, oftentimes ſhame thoſe who are high, proud, and impatient.</p>
                     <p>This man bears away the priſe, that wills all as God wills, and nills as he nills. This doubtleſſe is the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the moſt patient, the moſt ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of all the reſt, who hath his will moſt reſigned and united to God; He carries all cleerly before him, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes his will wholly to the will of God. Do but ſay, I will, and the palm of Patience is thine.</p>

                     <p>BUt this miſchievous word why, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles many in the School of Patience; why doth God this, why that? Why puniſheth he innocents, and diſmiſſeth guilty perſons? Why permits he ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſuch wicked enormities? Why will he have all done according to his will and pleaſure? This was the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the ſerpent asked the mother of mankind in Paradiſe: why hath God given you this commandment, that you ſhould not eate of all the trees of Paradiſe?</p>
                     <p>That, why, proceeding from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, muſt be utterly baniſhed from the Schoole of Patience: it is a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charge from our maſter: that it ſhould not be ſo much as named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you.</p>
                     <p>Saint Auguſtine gives a moſt exact anſwer to theſe ſerpents, ſaying; why do thunderbolts ſtrike ſometimes the mountaine, and ſpare the theefe? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perhaps God expects as yet the theefs converſion, and therefore ſtrikes the mountaine that fears not, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert that man who is capable of feare;
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:10478:260"/>
thou doeſt now and then the like, ſtriking the ground when thou giveſt correction, that thy child may be frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereat. But thou anſwereſt me: behold he puniſheth ſometimes the innocent, and pardons the guilty; what wonder? a good man alwaies and in all places is ready for a good end; but how canſt thou poſſibly know what puniſhment is reſerved, for that wicked perſon, unleſſe he repent him? How much rather would they (who at the day of Judgement ſhall heare theſe dreadfull words, go yee curſed into everlaſting fire) be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with thunder and lightning? It behoves thee to be innocent. For what matter is it whether a man die by ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, or by a feaver? we can neither ſay the one is an il death, nor the other a good; But whether he die by one or other, enquire of what courſe of life the man is that dies, whither he ſhall go after death, not by what accident he came to his death; Howſoever it be, live thou in fear, and ſee thou be good, by what death ſoever it pleaſeth God to take thee hence, let him find thee provided.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever therefore, as the ſame
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:10478:260"/>
Saint Auguſtine ſaith, happens in this world contrary to our will, know it happens not without the will of God, by his providence, by his ordinance, and expreſſe order; &amp; albeit we neither underſtand it, nor the end for which it is done, yet let us aſcribe ſo much to his providence, that it is not done without cauſe. For when we preſume to diſpute the works of God: as, why did h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Conſider all things in ſuch ſort that you may pleaſe God, &amp; praiſe him that made them. When you enter into a Smiths forge, you would not, doubtleſſe, preſume to find fault with his bellows, his hammers or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; preſumeſt thou not to queſtion a rude ſmith in his forge, &amp; wilt thou be ſo bold with God in his workmanſhip of this world? It is the property of an unskilfull man to reprehend all he ſees; you ſhall have another more skilfull then he, albeit better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the artificer, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be more familiar, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be a man that underſtands

For God ſaid, Be darkneſſe made, and it was made: yet did he diſpoſe of it when it was made: He likewiſe permits ſins, albeit he commit none, and orders and diſpoſes of them afterward, and by this means executes his will efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in all things.

And which moſt declares his infinite power and goodneſſe; he as carefully directs the leaſt things, as the greateſt; he as provident every moment directs every man in particular, as all men in generall; yea, he ſo tenderly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly diverts even the leaſt things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to each man, that there is none of them, but are deſigned for an excellent end, were it not that the will of man doth prejudice it ſelf, diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the ſupreme will of God.</p>
                     <p>No one, be he man or Angel, can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:10478:262"/>
alter or hinder what God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred from all eternity, what he hath determined to do or permit. He hath numbred and conſidered the very hairs of all creatures, the ſands of the ſea, the leaves of the trees; even the leaſt birds, the Sparrows, the Wrens, the motes of the air; all, even all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations both of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Angels.</p>
                     <p>What then canſt thou complain of, as if God regarded not thy calamities, as if he did not providently enough govern thee and thy affairs, or give too much liberty to thine enemies, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch a multitude of men and matters, neglect thee alone? Fooliſh man! Wilt thou ſtill be muttering theſe things to thy ſelf? Know that God diſpoſeth all things in number, weight, and meaſure, even thy affairs, even the leaſt thing thou takeſt in hand.</p>
                     <p>Call to mind, I beſeech thee, &amp; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy life paſt, and note whatſoever thou wouldeſt have had, in the whole courſe thereof, to have happened o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. Obſerve withall, that even this thing was by God brought moſt exactly to his own Idea; that is to ſay, to what hath pleaſed him from all
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:10478:263"/>
eternity, ſo hath it ſucceeded, ſo ſhall it hence forward ſucceed. Not ſo much as one jot, or one tittle, hath paſſed, nor ſhall paſſe in time to come, till all be performed according to this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of God.</p>
                     <p>The ſacred will of God ſhall ſtand moſt ſteadfaſt and inviolable. And tell me, I pray thee, what availed it thee then, to vex, grieve, and perplex thy ſelfe in vain, and to trouble others ſo much? What wilt thou get now by toſſing or turmoiling? Let me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee not to ſtumble again at the ſame ſtone; put on a mind of reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſubmit thy ſelfe freely and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the will of God; mount up into this Chariot of Gods providence; feare nothing, it is impoſſible to miſcarry: without Gods will and permiſſion, the leaſt thought, the leaſt finger, the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt more in the world is not able to ſtir againſt thee.</p>
                     <p>And as well for what is paſt, as for what is to come, let my perſwaſion take place: Conſider, I beſeech thee, what ſmall intereſt thy will or power hath in any of them: So little, that thou canſt ſeldome foreſee what will happen hereafter. Tell me, what kinde
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:10478:263"/>
of Summer ſhall we have next yeare? If a dry and barren one, dearth, plague and famine will enſue. What then will it avail thee to foreſee or grieve at this? The like may be ſaid of all things elſe. In very deed thou canſt neither obtaine what is good, nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee or ſhunne what is evill, unleſſe it be the will of God; refigne therefore thy will to his.</p>
                     <p>It is in vaine to vex and trouble thy ſelfe; to ſtrive or ſtrugle; it is loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to plot or build, unleſſe the will of God concurre thereunto: Thou ſhalt not prevaile, thou ſhalt not profit, unleſſe thou will that which God willes.</p>
                     <p>Be ſure therefore to performe this; ſubmit thy ſelfe in all things to the will and pleaſure of God. And I moſt earneſtly crave this one thing, that thou wouldeſt every day ſerioufly weigh and conſider in thy minde, as moſt certain, That God from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath prepared for thee this croſſe, and determined to lay it upon thee, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with all the circumſtances of place, time and perſons; and that he hath, according to his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſſe, ſquared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned

it agreeable to thy forces. It remains now only, that thou ſhouldeſt be willing to make benefite thereby; and this aſſuredly will be very great, if thou wilt but reſigne and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date thy will to Gods will.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, upon every ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſcourſe thus: This, doubtleſſe, comes from God, and therefore is for the beſt. This injury, this diſeaſe, this poverty, this trouble or miſery, is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, and therefore can import no evill unto me, unleſſe my will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Gods will. But take heed thou never utter ſuch kinde of words as theſe: Were it but this or that croſſe, it would never grieve me. A poore and idle complaint. This croſſe or that croſſe, how terrible ſoever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, embrace, and for this cauſe onely, that it is the will of God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thee with this and that, and with no other.

Policrates, King of the Samites, was thought in his time the very dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Fortune, he had never any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie in his life; heavens, ſea and land, all favoured him. All his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes had a facile and happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: whatſoever he hoped for, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the fruit thereof; it was no more but wiſh and have, his will and power were all one.

For by Orontes, one of the Noble men belonging to King Darius, he was faſtened upon a croſſe on the top of mount Mycalis, where he was made a miſerable, but an eminent ſpectacle of falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full felicity.</p>

But what, I pray you? The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of all this ſo great felicity was knit up on a gibbet. This was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick which Aman had built for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whether he would or no: So the corn falls with too much rankneſſe: So the boughes of trees, over-burdened with fruit, are broken<hi>:</hi> So the greateſt calm at ſea, foreſhews the fierceſt ſtorm. The ſame may be ſaid of mens lives and manners.</p>
                     <p>Mens mindes with wealth, eaſe, and daintie fare, run riot. The Moon ever waneth, when ſhe is come once to the full: and the further from the Sun, the fuller ſhe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Hence was it that God in times paſt
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:10478:266"/>
complained of his people: I ſatiated them, and they became adulterers: They were pampered and fattened, and foully tranſgreſſed my words. Where felicity reignes, there vertue common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is exiled.</p>
                     <p>Saint Ambroſe, Biſhop of Millan, as Paulinus recounteth, viſited a certaine rich man upon the way as he travelled; who, when he had entertained and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed him, as well with pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as good cheere, he made a long relation of his owne courſe of life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that he had never had any croſſe, or adverſity, that all things had ſucceded, not onely anſwerable, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven beyond his expectation, before he deſired them; yea more then he could deſire, ſo that he never knew what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to calamity. Saint Ambroſe was much aſtoniſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at this, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as if ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſudden occaſion had called him away, took his leave of that fortunate man and his houſe both at an inſtant. The reaſon he gave to his followers, of this his ſpeedy depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was this; That he feared the reſt of his entertainment would be but bad, in a houſe ſo extreamly happy, and with a man who all his life time had
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:10478:266"/>
never taſted adverſity. Wherefore he thought it expedient to flye thence in all haſte, leſt they together with ſuch an hoſt ſhould be involved in the ſame ruine. Saint Ambroſe had not gone far from thence, before the houſe with a ſudden and unexpected downfall, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed and buried all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
                     <p>How much better is it then to dwell with them, who are in this world toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and turmoiled with ſtormes, to acquire thereby reſt and happineſſe, where ruine and deſtruction are not to be feared? Here we lead a life conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually infeſted with temptations, alwayes expoſed to great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold dangers, and till we depart out of this world, are never ſecure; but this (whether it be known or unknown to thoſe who dream of having their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city here) exempts them not from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether as miſerable. There can be no true felicity ſubject to errour and perill. He is onely happy, who reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe wholly to the will of God, ſits aloft in the chariot of divine providence.</p>

Here we may ſee a father of a family, a great proficient in the School of Patience: here was a man, here was a man indeed, who was able, through an entire conformity to the will of God, ſo ſweetly to beare a loſſe of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Behold here an Oſtrich, that could devoure and digeſt iron; His barns were fited, but not his minde. This patience, preſerved and firmly fortified.</p>
                     <p>And ſee how the infinit liberality of God repaired this loſſe, as he did the calamities of Job, with manifold increaſe.

                     <p>To this Lord Chancelour of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I annex a Prince of Spain, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Borgias, the third Generall of the Society of Jeſus.

                     <p>This is true magnanimity indeed, and the only way to mitigate adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by reſigning thus our wills to the will of God, with a true conformity, and perfect reſignation, without the leaſt contradiction.</p>

This moſt choice and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Lady, I ſay, conſtantly exerciſed herſelfe in all vertuous actions, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, her principall endeavour was moſt exactly to joyne her will with Gods will. All adverſe chances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many happened daily, ſhe cheerfully
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:10478:270"/>
accepted from the hand of God, as ſpeciall favours; ſhe was invincible in ſuffering couragiouſly all ſiniſter acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever for Gods ſake. In which Art, by continuall practiſe, ſhe had at laſt ſo inured her minde, that in the foure laſt years of her life, wherein ſhe happily endevoured to attaine to perfection in this vertue, it was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in a little note-boke of hers, that ſhe conformed her will with Gods, more then an hundred times in a day.</p>
                     <p>Queſtionleſſe, to live according to the will of God, is a true life indeed, and death to live otherwiſe: whereof Saint Auguſtine ſpeaks moſt elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Aug. tom io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorm de verb. Apoſt. c. rca med.</note> ſaying; That certain Philoſophers of the Epicures, who lived according to the fleſh; and certain of the Stoicks, who lived according to the ſoul and ſpirit, contended with Saint Paul the Apoſtle, who lived according to God. The Epicure ſaid, My chiefeſt good is to injoy the fleſh. The Stoick, Mine to enjoy my ſpirit and ſoul. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaid; But my chiefeſt good is to adhere to God. The Epicure erres, the Stoick is deceived, the Chriſtian, who adheres to God and the divine will,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:10478:270"/>
can neither erre nor be deceived. For then the ſoul may be ſaid to live well, when it neither liveth according to the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT I have ſaid of the conformity of mans will to the will of God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in adverſity. S. Auguſtine moſt evidently confirms, where he diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth concerning the tolerating of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, ſaying: Become milde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and patient, as thou doeſt when
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:10478:273"/>
thou underſtandeſt that the reaſon, why evil men flouriſh, is, becauſe God will have it ſo. It is his will to ſpare wicked perſons; but thoſe whom he purpoſeth to reform, he reduceth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; the other are never reform'd, nor ſo much as corrected. He knowes well hereafter how to judge them. But that man is not milde nor patient, who will contradict the goodneſſe of of our Lord, his patience, his power, or the juſtice of the judge.</p>
               <p>Who then are called the upright of heart? Mary they who will that which God wills. God ſpareth ſinners, thou wouldeſt have him deſtroy them. Thou haſt therefore a crooked heart, a depraved will, ſeeing thou wouldeſt one thing and God another. It is Gods will to ſuffer evill men to live, but thou wouldeſt not have it ſo. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is patient and beareth with ſinners; thou wouldeſt not tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them. But, as I ſaid before, thou willeſt one thing, and God another. Convert thy heart, and direct it unto God, becauſe our Lord doth compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate thoſe that are infirme. Hee ſees in his myſticall body (his Church)
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:10478:273"/>
ſome infirme perſons, who at the firſt apply themſelves wholy to their owne will: but finding the will of God to be otherwiſe, they convert themſelves and their heart to entertaine his will, and to follow it.</p>
               <p>Seeke not therefore to wreſt and draw the wil of God to thine, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe correct thine according to the will of God. The will of God is a ſquare and rule not to be altered. As long as there is a ſtraight and direct rule, thou muſt have recourſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, thereby to correct thy crookedneſſe.</p>
               <p>But what would men have? It is not enough for them to have their owne will crooked, they would alſo make the will of God crooked, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne heart, that God might doe their will, whereas they ſhould do Gods will. Thus farre Saint Auguſtine.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay (O you mortalls!) doe you not yet conceive this doctrine of conforming your will to the will of God? which the ancient fathers, which the holy Scriptures ſo often inculcate. Doe we yet run ſo confidently of our owne heads, or ſtand ſo peremprorily
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:10478:274"/>
upon our owne opinions, that we dare repine at that which God wills, or will that which God will not? What we ſuffer, God will have us ſuffer; there is nothing more certaine then this, and this he willeth for our good, as a ſingular favour. Theſe favours (ſaieſt thou) I am nothing ambitious of. O thou, whom I can ſcarcely call man, but rather a beaſt, ignorant and uncapable of what belongs to heaven! looke I beſeech thee, how many even of the Noblity every where, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſeeke after labours, ſo that they may thereby gaine riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.

               <p>A certain Citizen, whom Leontius
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:10478:274"/>
calleth Philochriſtus, gave a good large ſumme of gold to John, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of Alexandria, as an almes to the poore, and affirmed it was all the gold he had, and therefore beſought this holy father, that he would be pleaſed to recommend to God in his prayers a ſon of his who was abſent, and upon condition he might returne ſafe, he ſhould thinke thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> gold very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
               <p>But to teſtifie how ſerious his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, he oftentimes with bended knee ſubmiſſively made obeiſance to the Patriarch, thinking thereby he ſhould ſooner obtaine his ſuite. This childe of his, whom he ſo earneſtly commended, was his only ſonne not above fifteene yeeres of age, whoſe returne he expected in a ſhip from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke. The Patriarch accepted the gold, and withall his ſuite, wondring at a minde ſo noble and generous, that could diſpiſe and ſet ſo light ſo great a ſumme of mony. Wherefore he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him all good fortune, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius ſaith, prayed much for him whileſt he himſelfe was preſent, and ſo diſmiſſed him. Afterward he ceaſed
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:10478:275"/>
not to offer up his prayers for him, who had ſo earneſtly begged them; for going forthwith into the Church, and laying the gold under the altar, he ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Divine ſervice; &amp; according to his promiſe praied to God, with all the fervour he could, that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to reſtore unto him his ſon and ſhip in ſaftey; ſome thirty daies after he had thus praied, this liberall citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſon died, and the ſhip fraught with merchandiſe was caſt away; three daies after the ſorrowfull news was brought, that his ſon was dead, the ſhip with all the merchandiſe loſt, and ſome few men eſcaped with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty boate that belonged to the ſhip.</p>
               <p>Conſider here the extream and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive griefe of this poor diſtreſſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he had parted with his gold, loſt his ſon, and the ſhip which he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: behold the reward of his piety and good diſpoſition; griefe without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not capable of any comfort. How well might then the Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſaying be applied to this moſt wofull and afflicted parent: If our Lord had not ſuccoured him, his ſoul had even dwelt in hell. The loſſe of
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:10478:275"/>
ſuch a ſhip, one would have thought, had been ſufficient to have daunted his manlike ſpirit, beſides the untimely death of his ſon; two wounds, alas! ſo deadly, that the leaſt of them might have brought him to utter deſolation.</p>
               <p>When this relation was made to John the Patriarch, the good Prelates grief was little leſſe then his whom the heavy diſaſter did moſt concerne; whereupon knowing not well what to do, nor whither to turn him, he moſt earneſtly beſought God Almighty to yield this ſorrowfull father ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, he thought not fit to ſend for him overwhelmed with griefe, but ſent one that was diſcreet to ſay thus unto him as in his name, Good Sir, be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; do not in any wiſe tax God for want of mercy: take courage, elevate your eies to heaven, and behold there everlaſting joyes and delights<hi>:</hi> our momentary and light tribulation works in us an eternall weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; whatſoever is done on earth is by the moſt juſt judgement of God; nor is there any diſaſter or chaſtiſment ſo great, that redounds not to our good, if we overcome it by ſuffering patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:10478:276"/>
God our moſt provident Father not only foreſaw, but alſo determined from all eternity what was moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for us; We, like ſilly infants, not knowing what is good or bad, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deſire and ſeek after thoſe things which are moſt hurtfull for us; Be therefore confident in God, in whoſe hand are thy ſhip and ſon.</p>
               <p>This doubtleſſe was a pious and well grounded conſolation: yet ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could theſe words penetrate a heart ſo deadly wounded; wherefore all humane comfort failing, the helpe of God was ready to aſſiſt. For the next night John the Patriarch ſeemed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to this afflicted citizen in his ſleep, and to utter theſe words: What troubles thee, my brother, and why doſt thou pine away thus with griefe? didſt thou not deſire me to petition God for thy ſons ſafe return? Behold he is ſafe for all eternity; &amp; know this for certain, if he had lived, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſafe to thee he had been everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly damned; as for thy ſhip know thus much, hadſt thou not obtained mercy by ſo liberall an alms, ſhe with all the paſſengers in her had been ſunk,

and thy brother like wiſe been buried in the ſea, who for thy comfort yet ſurvives. Ariſe then and render thanks to God, for that thy ſon is ſaved, and thy brother reſtord to theo alive.</p>
               <p>Philochriſtus, waking out of his dream, found himſelfe much more lightſome then before, and almoſt cleared of all his griefe; he ran forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the Patriarch, and threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his feer, declaring the viſion that had appeared to him that night, and how much he had been comforted by thoſe words; for which, quoth he, I yield moſt humble thanks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o God, who for my own good hath exerciſed me, and ſhewed himſelf no leſſe a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in theſe his chaſtiſements, then heretofore in his comforts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Straightwaies the Patriarch brake forth into theſe words: Glory be to thee O moſt benigne and moſt mercyfull God! Who deſpiſeſt not the prayers of thy ſervants; and turning to the citizen: aſcribe not this, ſaid he, to my prayers, but to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, and thy faith.</p>
               <p>Let us then learne, O you men of ſmall faith! to truſt in God, and not to
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:10478:277"/>
be daunted in adverſity or affliction; Let us learn to ſuffer adverſity not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Patiently, but likewiſe Cheerfully, and with thankſgiving, Why fear we? Why hang we backe? All is in vain; Let us reſt aſſured, and look for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, that we muſt ſuffer much; Let us prepare our minde for things of this nature, and let Patience be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with conſtancy; Let us abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely conform our will in all things, great or ſmall, to the will of God.</p>
               <p>Pope Pius the firſt, enduring, with invincible Patience, moſt grievous and deadly paines of the ſtone, was heard often to pray thus: Increaſe, O Lord, my paine, ſo thou give me more patience; Let us imitate him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit our minds and bodies be on all ſides afflicted, let us confidently ſay: Increaſe, my Lord Jeſu, my pain, but increaſe it ſo, that therewith thou be pleaſed to give increaſe of Patience.</p>
               <p>Much after the ſame manner did Saint Francis Xaverius, that famous Preacher to the Indians and Japoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; a man ſo infinitly deſirous of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, that even amidſt greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and difficulties, he was wont moſt
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:10478:277"/>
earneſtly to beg of God, not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of thoſe miſeries, unleſſe for his glory he might be reſerved for greater. And when he was at Rome in the Infirmary, &amp; knew before hand he was to undergo for Chriſts ſake, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold labours, want, hunger, thirſt, cold, heat, perſecutions, perils, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries both by ſea and land, with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpirit he exclaimed: Yet more, my Lord, yet more. For ſo great was his confidence in God, that he certainly beleeved, he who had given him that deſire, would alſo give him ſtrength to ſuffer all. Hence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thoſe couragious words: Yet more (my good Lord) yet more, let me ſuffer for thy ſake.</p>
               <p>Let us alſo (O you Chriſtians!) let us, I beſeech you, attempt ſomething worthy of heaven; and when we ſhall be in whatſoever miſeries, let us, with this bleſſed man cry out<hi>:</hi> Yet more, my Lord Jeſu, yet more: Increaſe our pains: for we are confident thou wilt increaſe our patience.</p>
               <p>But I end this whole diſcourſe of Patience with that bleſſed Martyr Melitho; who, albeit he were the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:10478:278"/>
youngeſt of thoſe fourty brave Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Souldiers, gave, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, a notable teſtimony of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courage and conſtancie. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a moſt reſolute Chriſtian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of a maſculine ſpirit, ſeeing her ſon with his thighs broken, and even gaſping for life, animated him moſt couragiouſly after this manner: Hold out yet, my childe, a little longer, lo! Chriſt ſtands ready at the doore, to ſuccour and reward thee: yet, my ſon, a little longer. He did ſo, and all inflamed with his mothers encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, gave up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Our good mother Patience, calls upon us after the ſame manner: Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (my ſon) a little, Chriſt your helper is at hand, and your reward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven almoſt in ſight: your paine and griefe will end in a moment: your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall beatitude is even now nigh at hand, which will continue with you for ever. Behold, an infinite company of bleſſed ſoules. All theſe by a little time well ſpent, have gained immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: By patient ſuffering, and by dying, they have obtained an endleſſe life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="541" facs="tcp:10478:278"/>
Why do we therefore refuſe and feare to ſuffer? By patience the minde is brought to contemne all afflictions and miſeries whatſoever. If thou wilt not ſuffer, thou refuſeſt to be crowned. This life (ſaith Saint Chryſoſtome) <note place="margin">

               <p>Heaven is bought with labour and paines. It is an old ſaying, Labour goes before meat. So Suidas reports, <note place="margin">

ſin to ſuffer, but to do evill.</p>
               <p>Nay, as the ſame S. Chryſoſtome <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chryſ. tom.</hi> 4. <hi>in cap.</hi> 1 <hi>ad Philip. hom.</hi> 4 <hi>mihi, pag.</hi> 1031.</note> moſt expreſly affirmeth: To ſuffer for Chriſt is a free offering, and indeed more worthy admiration, then to raiſe the dead, or worke miracles: for there I am a debtor to Chriſt, here I have Chriſt a debtor to me. Moreover, a Chriſtian in this reſpect ſhould differ from an Infidell, by ſuffering all things couragiouſly; mounting, as it were, with wings, above the reach of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſaſters. A faithfull man is placed upon a Rock, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expugnable, what waves ſoever ſhall beat againſt him.</p>
               <p>Saint Paul declaring this as a great gift, and a ſingular favour, ſaith: To you it is given, not onely to beleeve in Chriſt; but alſo to ſuffer for him. For, according to Saint Gregory, Chriſt hath not promiſed to his elect in this world, the joy of delectation, but the bitterneſſe of tribulation, that by meanes of this bitter potion, as by Phyſick, they may recover their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall health.</p>
               <p>But what needs any further teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? They are the very words of
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:10478:280"/>
our Lord, the Oracle of eternall truth: He that takes not up his croſſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes me, is not worthy of me. Here is no ſparing of any, no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or prerogative; no priviledge. He is unworthy of Chriſt, who caſts away his croſſe, and will not follow Chriſt. Thy croſſe, be it never ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, muſt be patiently taken up. The deareſt friends of Chriſt, even his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea Chriſt himſelf lived under the ſame law.</p>
               <p>In times paſt Judith, that widow full of all ſincere candor and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, publickly commended patience with a moſt elegant oration, ſaying: But they who have not accepted of temptations, with the fear of our Lord, but have diſcovered their impatience, and the ſcorn &amp; reproch of their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt God, are utterly baniſhed: Let us therfore with humility expect his conſolation, becauſe our fathers have been tempted, that triall might be made of them, whether they did truly worſhip their God. As your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham was tempted; and after he had been by many tribulations tried, was made the friend of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:10478:280"/>
So Iſaac, ſo Jacob, ſo Moſes: And all the faithfull people who pleaſed God, paſſed through many tribulations.</p>
               <p>Why ſtrive or ſtruggle we any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Thus all have paſſed: All, all, whoſoever they were, that pleaſed God. Not one is ever to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faithfull, or approved, who is not marked with this brand of Patience and Affliction.</p>
               <p>This Oracle of Judith, hath, and alwayes ſhall ſtand moſt aſſuredly true and inviolable. All the faithfull that at any time have pleaſed God, have paſſed through many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tribulations. This is to ſuffer for Chriſt, this to reigne with Chriſt. This is the Kings high way to heaven, narrow indeed, and rough, but ſecure. Let us ſuffer and endure but a little; ſuccour ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will come, doubt ye not, if you do but ſtand to it in the battell; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if you overcome.</p>
